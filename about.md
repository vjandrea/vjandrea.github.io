# Andrea Bergamasco

#### I turn knobs, move faders, push buttons for a living.

grandMA2 operator since May 2k17, I'm trying to learn as much as I can.
I thought that sharing my study notes might be useful to other programmers.

### Roadmap

This is a list of what I'm planning to add in the future:

- structure of XML exports of most common functions
- structure of features, attributes and sub-attributes, possibly in a node-base browsing system
- notes on LUA programming in the desk and API extension
- tests to run in the desk using a mix of LUA and Macros

If you spot an error or want to suggest the addition of new content,
