		<h1>Record a macro</h1>
		
		<p>You can make a live recording of a macro.</p>

<p>This is the workflow when recording macros:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start the macro recording</li>
	<li>Type the needed commands</li>
	<li>Stop the macro recording</li>
</ol>

<p>The recording only contains commands that are visible in the Command Line Feedback and the time between the commands.</p>

<p>It does not record fader movement and screen presses (unless they trigger a command).</p>

<p>The <a href="key_keyword_record.html">Record command</a> is needed to start and stop the recording of macros. You can easily reach the Record keyword by pressing the <span class="hardkey">MA</span> key together with the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> key.</p>

<p>When you have the Record keyword in your command line then you press the <span class="hardkey">Macro</span> key and then type the macro number you want to record to - execute the command with a <span class="hardkey">Please</span>.</p>

<p>If the macro you want to recording to, has already some content, the new recorded content will be added after the existing commands.</p>

<p>To stop the recording you will need to use the Record keyword again. You can, but you do not need to specify the macro number.</p>

<p><span class="hardkey">MA</span>+<span class="hardkey">Store</span> (Record) <span class="hardkey">Macro</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Please</span> ends the recording.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different things happen while you are recording a macro:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The background light of the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> and <span class="hardkey">Macro</span> keys are flashing.</li>
	<li>There is a small red circle in the upper right corner of the macro pool object you are recording to.</li>
	<li>There is a&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../../img/icon_macro-record_v3-2.png" /> icon in the message center part of the command line input.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The recorded macro will be a timed macro. This means that it will execute the commands with the same speed as they where recorded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a macro pool visible then you can also tap the pool object to start and stop the recording:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press <span class="hardkey">MA</span> + <span class="hardkey">Store</span> (Record)</li>
	<li>Tap the macro pool object</li>
</ol>

<p>It is the same workflow for starting and stopping the recording.</p>
