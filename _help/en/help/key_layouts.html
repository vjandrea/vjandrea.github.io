		<h1>Layouts</h1>
		
		<p>Layouts are basically two-dimensional drafts where it is possible to arrange channels and fixtures, draw shapes and add text, macros, presets and other pool objects. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Layouts are created in the layout pool and are displayed and edited in the layout view.&nbsp;</p>
