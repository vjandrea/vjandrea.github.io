		<h1>Display</h1>
		
		<p>The Display tab has potentially a lot of options - all dealing with how the data in the sheets are presented to you.</p>

<p>This topic lists all the possible options in the sheets, but each sheet does not have all options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sheet Style</h2>

<p><strong>Sheet Style</strong> is an option in Fixture and Content sheets.</p>

<p>This can be used to turn how the data is presented in the sheets.</p>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Horizontal:</strong><br />
	This will present the fixtures as rows and the Attributes as columns.</li>
	<li><strong>Vertical:</strong><br />
	This will organize the fixtures as columns and the Attributes as rows.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default is Horizontal, but some like to use the vertical in situation where you have few fixtures. For instance when programming Media Servers.</p>

<h2>Font</h2>

<p><strong>Font</strong> is an option in all sheets.</p>

<p>There is currently only one font type available in the grandMA2 software. So the only thing to change regarding the Font is the size.</p>

<p>Tapping the button opens the Small Select Font pop-up. It looks like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-font_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Small Select Font pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here it is possible to select one of the six different sizes - ranging from 10 to 22.</p>

<h2><a id="readout" name="readout"></a>Readout</h2>

<p><strong>Readout</strong> is an option in Channel, DMX, Fixture, Content, and Tracking sheets.</p>

<p>The readout determines how the values are displayed in the sheets.</p>

<p>Tapping the button opens a small Select Readout pop-up like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-readout_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Small Select Readout pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here it is possible to select one of the following options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Natural:</strong><br />
	This displays the value defined in the "From" and "To" columns in the fixture profile. The range is customized, but is is always displayed with one decimal accuracy. It can even be a negative value. This can be useful when the attributes default values is not at the end of the range - for instance with Pan attributes.</li>
	<li><strong>Percent:</strong><br />
	Displays the attribute values as a percent without any decimal numbers. Range is 0 through 100.</li>
	<li><strong>Decimal:</strong><br />
	Displays the attribute values as an 8-bit DMX value. The range is from 0 through 255.</li>
	<li><strong>Hex:</strong><br />
	This displays the DMX values in 8-bit Hexadecimal numbers. The range is from 0 through FF.</li>
	<li><strong>Physical:</strong><br />
	This displays the value defined in the "From Phys" and "To Phys" columns in the fixture profile. Just as with the Natural readout, it is possible to customize the range but it is always displayed with one decimal accuracy. The idea is that values here matches the physical values for the fixtures. So for instance the zoom range of a fixture is matched to the physical range of the fixture making the sheets display the actual zoom degree.</li>
	<li><strong>Decimal16:</strong><br />
	This is just like the Decimal readout except the DMX value is displayed in a 16-bit range. The range is from 0 through 65 535.</li>
	<li><strong>Hex16:</strong><br />
	This is just like the Hex readout except the DMX value is displayed in a 16-bit range. The range is from 0 through FFFF.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changing the readout for a sheet and then tapping in the sheet will also change the readout on your Encoder Bar.</p>

<p>Readout can also be a <a href="key_of_sheet_options_title_buttons.html">Title Button</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="cue_color_columns" name="cue_color_columns"></a>Cue Color Columns</h2>

<p><strong>Cue Color Columns</strong> is an option in Executor and Tracking sheets.</p>

<p>Tapping the button opens the small Select Cue Color Columns pop-up. It has two different sizes regarding the options. There are more options in the Executor sheet than in the Tracking sheet. This is the pop-up from the Executor sheet:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-cue-color-columns_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Small Select Cue Color Columns pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The options in the pop-up are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Off:</strong><br />

	<li><strong>Number:</strong><br />
	This will display the color in the cue number column.</li>
	<li><strong>Number+Name:</strong><br />
	This will display the color in the cue number and name columns.</li>
	<li><strong>Number+Info:</strong><br />
	This will display the color in the cue number and info columns.</li>
	<li><strong>Info:</strong><br />
	This will display the color in the info columns only.</li>

	This will display the color in all columns.</li>

<p><strong>Sort By</strong> is an option in Content and Tracking sheets.</p>

<p>This option can be used to choose the sort method for the sheets.</p>

<p>There are two options: <strong>Fixture ID</strong> or <strong>Channel ID</strong>. This option makes sense if your fixtures do not have the same number as Fixture ID or Channel ID. Then this chooses the priority for the sorting.</p>

<h2>Symbol Output</h2>

<p><strong>Symbol Output</strong> is an option in Channel and Fixture sheets.</p>

<p>The Symbol Out is a small square next to the Channel ID in the Channel Sheet and next to the fixture name in the Fixture Sheet. This square shows the combined intensity and color output from the fixture.</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-symbol-output_v3-3.png" />

</figure>

<p>The options are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>None:</strong><br />
	The square is hidden.</li>
	<li><strong>Auto:</strong><br />
	The squares output follows the selected layer.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Layer:</strong><br />
