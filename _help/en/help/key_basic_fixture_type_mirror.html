		<h1>Mirror</h1>
		
		<p>The Mirror fixture type defines a type of fixtures with typically a discharge light source like the HDI types. Typically it is a single body fixture with a white light source that is shaped, colored, filtered and the resulting beam shines into a motorized mirror that will move the light beam. Compared to modern moving head fixture, mirrors often have a limited pan and tilt range. It could be a pan range of 180° and a tilt range of 90°.</p>

<p>The default model used in MA 3D is a classic Scanner type.</p>
