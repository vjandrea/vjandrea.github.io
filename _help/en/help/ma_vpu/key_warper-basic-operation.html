			<p>If a new warper object is added you can define the properties of the object in the upcoming dialog.<br />
			Name; Width; Heigth and the Render Mode:<br />
			A warper 3D object supports three modes. These are "Stretched", "3D" and "Orthogonal".<br />
			The mode can be set&nbsp; when creating the object and can be changed at the edit dialog of the warper 3D object at the warper editor.<br />
			The default mode is "Stretched" which is also the behavior of prior versions of the MA VPU.<br />
			When using a warper object on a camera the mode "3D" is not supported and behaves like "Stretched".</p>

			<p>Using the warper object on a layer:<br />
			o&nbsp; Stretched: The warper object is stretched to fit the output and ignores the ratio of the warper 3D object.<br />
			This mode does not support any 3D functionality like positioning, rotation or scaling.<br />
			o&nbsp; 3D: The warper object is drawn with its defined resolution.<br />
			The center of the object matches the center of the output.<br />
			This mode supports full functionality inside the 3D space.<br />
			The object can be positioned, rotated and scaled like other 3D objects.<br />
			But remember the warper object itself is still a 2-dimensional object.<br />
			o&nbsp; Orthogonal: The warper object is drawn with its native resolution.<br />
			The center of the object matches the center of the output.<br />
			This mode does only support positioning on the x- and y-axis.<br />
			Positioning in this mode moves the object without interpolating pixels, so the mesh stays pixel accurate.<br />
			As orthogonal mode is a&nbsp; 2-dimensional mode, it is the most pixel accurate one of the three modes.<br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			Using a warper object on a camera:<br />
			o&nbsp; Stretched: The warper object is stretched to fit the output.<br />
			3D functionality like positioning, rotation or scaling is not supported. &nbsp;<br />
			o&nbsp; 3D: This mode can be used on a layer only.<br />
			If it is used on a camera it behaves like "Stretched".<br />
			o&nbsp; Orthogonal: The object is drawn with its native resolution.<br />
			The center of the object matches the center of the output.<br />
			The object can be positioned with the PosX and PosY attribute of the cameras 3D Key feature.<br />
			Orthogonal mode is also the most pixel accurate one when using the object on a camera.</p>

			<td>In the 'Warper Settings’ you can define the Warper object. It is handled by the VPU like the other 3D objects but it only has 2 dimensions X and Y.<br />
			In prior versions the calculation of UV mapping referred to the width and height of the parent warper 3D object. Now the width and the height of a texture can be defined as base values of the calculation of the corresponding UV E.g. a warper object has a dimension of 1920 x 1080 which also fits the resolution of the output. The content has a resolution of 7680 x 1080 (4 times full HD). In this example the warper object is used on a layer and shall "grab" the third full HD space from the texture using the UV mapping. For this case the UV mapping is: U from 3841 to 5760 of 7680 and V from 1 to 1080 of 1080.<br />
			The UV parameters are based on pixels and are scaled to one. If you have a texture with a resolution of full HD, enter the parameters from 1 to 1920. All position parameters of the warper are pixel based and scaled to zero. Position 0,0 corresponds to the top left of the screen.</td>

<p>Warper 3D objects can contain several meshes. These meshes divide the projection area into several parts that are defined in the window 'Warper Meshes’. E.g. if your projection area is only one big bended plane you only need one mesh. If the area is splitted into different objects it favorable to use different meshes for these objects&nbsp; E.g. if the projection plane is covered with a box you can define a separate mesh for this box, put this box in front position and edit the characteristics.</p>

			<strong>Name:</strong>&nbsp;Enter a name for the mesh.<br />
			<strong>Width, Height, Position X/Y: </strong>If a mesh is created with 'Add’ it is placed to the position (0,0).<br />
			If the mesh is edited later the entry describes the center of the mesh in X/Y coordinates of the 3D object in pixel.<br />
			A mesh can have a maximum resolution of 16384 x 16384.<br />
			Please note that using very high resolution meshes does cost performance.</p>

			<p><strong>Maximum Size of Submesh Tile:</strong><br />
			Warper meshes with a low grid resolution can be rendered with a higher sub grid resolution to reduce artifacts.<br />
			This option is enabled by default. The maximum tile size of the grid can be adjusted at the options of a mesh.<br />
			The default is set to a maximum tile size of 32 pixels. The higher the value of the maximum tile size, the coarser the sub grid.<br />
			If the value is set to "none", the mesh resolution equals the grid resolution. Use this value to improve the performance if you do not warp the mesh.</p>

			<p><strong>Resolution X/Y:&nbsp;</strong>Describes the grid resolution of the mesh.<br />
			The maximum resolution of the grid is 128 x 128.<br />
			The grid divides the mesh into faces that can be manipulated.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>U From, To: V From, To:&nbsp;</strong>Describes how the original image is mapped on the mesh.<br />
			If the U and V values are higher than the resolution of the image, the image is tiled like the VImg Split effect in the layers.</p>

			<p>The UV mapping of a warper mesh can be edited graphically.<br />
			This can be done in grid mode only. Activate the button "UV mode" at the tool bar of the warper editor.<br />
			You can also use the "u" key of a connected keyboard to toggle the UV Mode. The controls "Move", "Rotate" and "Scale" then modifies the UV mapping of selected spaces instead of the mesh itself.</p>

			<p>A mesh now can also be rotated and scaled using the arrow keys.</p>

			<p>Vertex data of a mesh can be edited numerically. The vertex position as well as its UV coordinates can be modified.<br />
			To edit a vertex change to the grid mode and select a vertex.<br />
			Then click "Edit Vertex" at the tool bar. The related keyboard short cut is "V".<br />
			Editing of vertex data requires knowledge in the field of&nbsp; UV mapping and vertex addressing conversion from pixel to texel.</p>
