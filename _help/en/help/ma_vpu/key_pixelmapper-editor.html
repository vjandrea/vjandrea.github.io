			<td><strong>Library:&nbsp;</strong>In the library tab on the left side you can select each fixture layer of the setup that contains fixtures you want to use.<br />
			Select these fixtures and press the <span class="softkey">Add to Output</span> button.<br />
			A pop-up will ask, which axis is used: any combination can be done and each axis can be inverted.<br />
			This is used to "transfer" the position from the 3D stage view environment into the 2D footprint in the VPU.<br />
			This process is comparable to the option "take Camera" in the Layout View, but with fixed positions.</td>

			<td><strong>Area/Output:</strong>&nbsp;The general output of MA VPU is done via Ethernet protocols like Art-Net instead of the graphic card of the PC.<br />
			Therefore the physical dimensions of the LED matrix (Area) and the number of pixels (Output) can be set:</td>

			<td><strong>Areas:</strong>&nbsp;Here the physical width and height of the LED matrix is determined.<br />
			This must not be conform to the whole size of the LED Panels.<br />
			So e.g. only sub ranges of the general view of the LED Panels can be set.<br />
			To set the dimensions of an area, select the area and press <span class="softkey">Edit</span>. The area is defined in n * m cm.&nbsp;<br />
			<strong>Outputs:</strong> List of the outputs. Every pixel mapper output can contain several fixtures. Network settings can be defined seperately for every output.</td>

			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td><strong>Virtual Output:</strong>&nbsp;The output of the Pixel Mapper can be mapped as a virtual input of a layer.<br />
			In this case the render IP is suppressed.&nbsp;<br />
			<strong>Render IP:</strong>&nbsp;Set which MA VPU shall render the output by choosing its MA-Net2 IP.&nbsp;<br />
			<strong>Camera Idx:</strong>&nbsp;Index of the camera used for this output.&nbsp;<br />
			<strong>Delay:&nbsp;</strong>To each graphic output or Pixel Mapper output a delay can be assigned.<br />
			The value accords to the refresh rate of the output (not of the video clip).<br />
			For each output of the pixel mapper a delay from up to 8/30 Seconds can be set (refresh rate for DMX signal is 30/s).<br />
			<strong>Protocol: </strong>Choose between Art-Net, sACN or MA-Net2 protocol. sACN is comparable to Art-Net but allows the multicast option to reduce network traffic. (American National Standard E1.31.2009)<br />
			<strong>Priority:</strong> Set a priority for the output regarding to the playback priorities of the grandMA2 desk. Default is "low".</td>

			<td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;The physical dimensions of the source picture must not confirm to the whole size of the panels.<br />
			The LED panels can display, for example only a sub range of the whole output.<br />
			In this example the area size is 1,25m x 1,0 m with 25 x 20 pixel.<br />
			There are only 16 panels used (5 x 5 LEDs).<br />
			The middle stripe is not equipped with LED panels and is not used.</td>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
The Pixel Mapper works best if the resolution X of the output can be divided by 8.</div>

<p><strong>Start Universe Art-Net and sACN:</strong></p>

<p>To each output of the Pixel Mapper a start universe can be assigned for Art-Net or sACN.<br />
This function is necessary to adress control data via Art-Net or sACN independent from their patch addresses:</p>

<p><strong>sACN:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_vpu/vpu_sacn_dialog.png" /></p>

<p>If the start universe is not changed by the operator, data will be sent as patched in the desk.<br />
If a start universe is defined here, the lowest patched universe of the corresponding Pixel Mapper output will be used.<br />
Other patched universes gear to this start universe.<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> 4 LED panels are patched to universe 11, 12, 13 and 20 and the sACN start universe is set to 1.<br />
Then control data are sent on universe 1,2,3, and 10.<br />
The user can choose a start universe (as defined in sACN specs.) between 1 and 63999.<br />
If the user sets the "Original" button, DMX data will be send again as patched in the desk.</p>

<p><strong>Art-Net:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_vpu/vpu_artnet_dialog.png" /></p>

<p>Same principle with Art-Net. In this case with Art-Net specific entries of the start universe.<br />
If the user sets the "Original" button, DMX data will be send again as patched in the desk.</p>
