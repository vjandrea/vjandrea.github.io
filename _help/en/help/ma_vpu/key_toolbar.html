		<h1>Toolbar</h1>
		
		<p>The toolbar contains several buttons that are related to the general operations of the program.</p>

<p><strong>Network…</strong></p>

<p>Shows the actual network state or opens the MA Network dialog as described in: <a href="key_file.html">File...</a></p>

<p><strong>Toggle GUI &lt;-&gt; Fullscreen:</strong></p>

<p>Switches the GUI (Graphical User Interface) off. You can also use the 'Shift + Enter’ key on the keyboard to switch the GUI off.<br />
Leave or switch&nbsp;to&nbsp;fullscreen mode with the 'Shift + Enter’ button.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Hint</strong>:<br />
​MA VPU always runs in fullscreen view.<br />
Only if the VPU is installed on a PC with a protection dongle (former grandMA Video application) the switching between windowed and fullscreen is relevant.<br />
Therefore you can use the „Alt + Enter" key.</div>

<p><strong>Show Mode:</strong></p>

<p>This mode avoids interruptions of the running show caused by manual operations of a user.<br />
Also non essential functionality is reduced or disabled to increase the performance.<br />
It can be set by a channel in the Master fixture or this button.<br />
The following actions are performed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>GUI is disabled</li>
	<li>Thumbnails are not distributed to avoid network traffic</li>
	<li>Preview of the outputs of the VPU is set to Pause</li>
	<li>Frame rate of the GUI screen (if turned on) is limited to 10 fps</li>
	<li>Frame rate of the VPU Plus internal screen is limited to 5 fps</li>
	<li>No clip preview is displayed at Content Editor</li>
	<li>Speed of content distribution is reduced to 10 %</li>
	<li>Highlight functionality of the pixel mapper is turned off</li>
	<li>CITP is disabled</li>
	<li>Testpattern is disabled</li>
	<li>Monitor identification is disabled</li>
	<li>Hap Converter is paused</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Show Mode is set permanently (via control channel in the master fixture) the user cannot turn on the GUI of the VPU and the internal screen shows "Show Mode locked"..</p>

<p><strong>Accept Blind:&nbsp;</strong>(Only enabled if the 'FOH Features’ in the Options dialog is enabled)</p>

<p>You can take or reject the 'Blind Preview’ from the desk by selecting the appropriate check buttons. If the 'Blind Preview is active, the button gets blue.</p>

<p><strong>Channels:&nbsp;</strong><strong>(Only enabled if 'Multi Preview’ tab is selected)</strong></p>

<p>Toggle the Channel controls in the 'Multi Preview’.</p>

<p><strong>Reset Windows:</strong></p>

<p>Resets the window layout of the 'Multi Preview’ to the standard.</p>

<p><strong>Store Alignment:</strong></p>

<p>Stores the alignment of the window layout on the local VPU (not in the showfile).</p>
