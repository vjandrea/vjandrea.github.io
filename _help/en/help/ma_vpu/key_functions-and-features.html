		<h1>Functions and Features</h1>
		
		<p>At its most basic level, MA VPU allows for the control of several moving images and high-resolution images simultaneously. Videos and still images can be combined, mixed and controlled using any grandMA console like a regular multi-parameter fixture. For this, several 3D video layers are available plus one master fixture (master layer) for PC remote controlling, shaper, iris and scaling settings,&nbsp;camera fixtures (output layers) for Shaper, Iris, Effects, Scaling, Camera Positions, Keystone and Softedge</p>

<p>In addition, MA VPU offers the possibility of choosing any three dimensional object as a surface for video or still images. Cubes, cylinders, spheres, extruded logos or any other three-dimensional shape can be “textured” with complimentary images or videos. The position and orientation of these three dimensional objects are fully controllable from the grandMA console. You could start with a cube rotating and progress to a three-dimensional logo flying around, but from then on, you are only limited by your imagination.</p>

<p>Each image or video that is used at the same time requires a layer. Since the opacity of each layer is controllable, it is possible to cross fade from one video image to another by cross fading from one layer to another. By controlling and mixing the output of the MA VPU, your grandMA2 console has become a video mixer.</p>
