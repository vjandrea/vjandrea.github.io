		<h1>Principle function diagram</h1>
		
		<p>The following pattern demonstrates how data is processed.</p>

<p>If you connect the grandMA VPU to a grandMA2 desk you can compare the result with some slide projectors remote controlled by an MA desk.<br />
In contrast to a slide projector the slides are not projected on the screen.<br />
The screens or 3D objects are active light emitters like monitors and can take the shape of any geometric form.<br />
This takes place on so called “layers”. Each layer output feeds a virtual camera.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The virtual camera outputs can be mixed up to a resulting video output.</li>
	<li>Each layer has its own magazine containing emitting 3D objects.</li>
	<li>Each layer has its own magazine containing videos, images and masks.</li>
	<li>The number of 3D video layers can vary in dependence of the complexity of your show.</li>
	<li>You can patch up to 32 layers</li>
</ul>

<p>If the grandMA VPU is invited in a session by the desk, layers behave similar to a fixture. All layers have access to the same content pool.<br />
The application receives the amount of layers and each layer magazine is assembled with several images and videos.<br />
These are indicated by their relative paths and names.<br />
If a layer 3D object or the content of a magazine is changed within grandMA VPU, the changed properties are immediately taken up by the desk.<br />
Several grandMA VPU applications are shown in several 'fixture layers’ on the MA-desk.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows a principle structure with 4 layers.</p>
