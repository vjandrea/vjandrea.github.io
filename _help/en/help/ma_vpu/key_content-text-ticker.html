<p>Already created Text Ticker items can be adjusted by using the option "edit" in the context menu. To display the Text Ticker item on screen, simply select it via the IPool / Image Channel.</p>

<p>Four attributes allow the use of the text ticker</p>

<p>Compos Type: Choose how the Text Ticker is animated</p>

<p>Compos Speed: Choose how fast the animation is done</p>

<p>Compos P1: Choose how long the pause in the middle of the animation is</p>

<p>Compos P2: For Future Use (currently not implemented)</p>

<p>The animation can be edited via the grandMA2 command line (incl. import and export). The animations are based on keyframes. They can be adjusted or new frames can be added. They are located in the PixelMapperContainer/Videocompositioncontainer.</p>
