		<h1>Master slave</h1>
		
		<p>The MA console or onPC is always the master of a session. If the MA VPU is started as standalone it is not in a session. If a desk is connected and a session is started within the desk the VPU becomes the slave. So the synchronization of desk and video data is guaranteed.</p>
