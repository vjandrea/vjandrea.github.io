		<h1>Layer Reference</h1>
		
		<p>If you choose a 'Layer Reference’ as input source for a layer the layer shows the input from the source layer. This saves performance because the video must not be decoded twice. For example if layer 1 shows a video and layer 2 takes layer 1 as reference the video has only to be decoded for layer 1. Layer 2 can be used to set effects. To use the 'Layer Reference’ use the&nbsp;layer fixture and select Layer Reference as content. The related channel sets are located at the I-pool standard folder. If you want to add them to another folder, look for a free channel set and select 'Insert for Layer References' via right mouse button.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important </strong><br />
Only the video itself is feed into the other layer, not the changes in color or effects etc.&nbsp;</div>
