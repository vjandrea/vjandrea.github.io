		<h1>Main Features</h1>
		
		<p>MA VPU is the Video Processing Unit for the grandMA range of lighting control consoles. It uses a WindowsÂ® operating system to facilitate the control of video and still images directly from any grandMA console and runs on readily available PC hardware. As fully integrated part of the grandMA network system, MA VPU is not just triggered via DMX. This has many advantages. On the one hand a minimum of setup and configuration is required due to bi-directional communication between the console and the MA VPU. On the other hand the grandMA console allows for direct access to the server and previews the content as thumbnails in the preset.</p>

<p>The MA VPU enables a console operator to control and alter videos, still images and three-dimensional objects in real-time from a grandMA lighting console. Three-dimensional objects can be textured with video clips or animated images. Videos, still images and three-dimensional objects can be manipulated in multiple ways and in the same intuitive manner as a lighting fixture is manipulated from the grandMA console.</p>
