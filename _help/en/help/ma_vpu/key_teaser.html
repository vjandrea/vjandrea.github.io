		<h1>Teaser Mode</h1>
		
		<p>To try out the functionality of MA VPU on a PC without purchasing a VPU, use the Teaser Mode. With the Teaser Mode, you can use the MA VPU software without a dongle for small applications without a water mark.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Maximum 2 patched VPU Layers</li>
	<li>Maximum 1 VPU station in a session</li>
	<li>Maximum 1 DVI output (assigned in Display Settings)</li>
	<li>Maximum video content below 800x600 pixels (there is no limitation for pictures or sound files)</li>
</ul>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
Since V3.1 the MA VPU Pixel Mapper works independent from VPU hardware.<br />
The Pixel Mapper then only works within MA-Net (not with Art-Net or sACN) and can be mapped on the parameters of the selected session.</div>

<p>If one of the above limitations is not met, a water mark is displayed. Teaser Mode status messages are displayed in a docking frame dialog named "Teaser Status" that is displayed by default.<br />
If the user disabled the docking frame or the Teaser Status window, this dialog appears automatically if a violation of the teaser rules occurs. This will only happen once in a showfile.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important</strong>:<br />
You have to install the full Mainconcept MPEG2 Decoder to be able to playback videos without a water mark. The VPU Teaser changes the water mark of the VPU software. For testing purposes, it is possible to use the MPEG2 Demo Decoder.</div>
