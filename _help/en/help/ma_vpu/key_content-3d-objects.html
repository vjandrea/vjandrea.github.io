		<h1>Content: 3D Objects</h1>
		
		<p>The tab ,3D-Objects' shows the projection objects of the layers.</p>

<p>In the simplest case a layer contains a 2D plane object. This is a canvas where images or videos are shown like on a TV screen. But this screen mustn't be flat. You can use 3D boxes, cones or other 3 dimensional objects to render your images or videos.</p>

<p>The file format is DirectX with the file extension '.x' see: <a href="key_creation-of-customized-3d-objects.html">Creation of customized 3D Objects</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3D object definitions:</strong></p>

<p>If you use objects with the extension ,<strong>@r</strong>' like ,<strong>Plane@r.x</strong>' the aspect ratio of the object fits automatically to the aspect ratio of the texture (Ratio of width / height e.g. 16/9). So we recommend using this object (Plane@r.x) for the easy projection of videos.</p>

<p><strong>@Native.x:</strong>&nbsp;pixelexact keeps image resolution. This is a 2-dimensional object with defined size (defined by image resolution!). Scaling, Rotation and Position Z is possible, but leads to the loss of nativity.</p>

<p><strong>@Output.x:</strong>&nbsp;scales to full output resolution and ignores ratio. Scaling, Rotation and Position Z not possible as this is a 2-dimensional object with defined size (defined by output resolution!).</p>

<p><strong>@OutputR.x:</strong>&nbsp;scales to full output resolution and keeps image ratio (Letterbox). Scaling, Rotation and Position Z not possible as this is a 2-dimensional object with defined size (defined by output resolution!).</p>
