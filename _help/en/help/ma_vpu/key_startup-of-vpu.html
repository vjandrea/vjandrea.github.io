		<p>This chapter describes the startup of the MA VPU application.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>For Dongle Users only:</strong> To realize an auto start of the MA VPU application a startup software 'VPULoader.exeâ€™ is installed on the target machine at:<br />
C:\Program Files\MA Lighting Technologies\grandMA VPU Loader</div>

<p>This program is called by the operating system (e.g. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) in startup of the MA VPU.</p>

<p>At the initial start after the installation or the update of the MA VPU application, the end user license agreement is shown.</p>

<p>The MA VPU application will not start, until the end user license agreement is confirmed.</p>

<p>If you are using a MA VPU plus, the end user license agreement is shown at the internal touch display.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
If you are using a MA VPU basic or MA VPU light, the end user license agreement is shown at the first external DVI-output - so connect a display and a mouse to the MA VPU basic or MA VPU light.</div>

<p>&nbsp;At the end user license agreement the user has the choice to install additional third party codecs, which can be used at the new Hap-Converter.</p>
