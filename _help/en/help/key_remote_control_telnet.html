		<h1>Telnet Remote</h1>
		
		<p>The grandMA2 can be remote controlled via Telnet.</p>

<p>This gives access to command line. Any command that can be executed locally in the command line on a station, can also be done using the Telnet connection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It needs to be enabled in the Global Settings: <strong>Setup -&gt; Console -&gt; Global Settings -&gt; Telnet</strong></p>

<p>Here is a setting called "Telnet" with two options: <strong>Login Disabled</strong> and <strong>Login Enabled</strong>.</p>

<p>When it is enabled, then the station (Console or onPC) can be reached by its IP address and the IP port number 30000 - do not use the Telnet default IP port 23.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
Using port 30001 gives read only access to the <a href="key_ost_system_monitor.html">System Monitor</a>.</div>

<p>Using this IP address and port number will give access to the command line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using a telnet program like PuTTy the feedback from the grandMA2 will look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/img_putty_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>PuTTy Telnet feedback</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is not actually logged in as the default <strong>guest</strong> user, even though the feedback writes it.</p>

<p>Before any commands can be sent to the system, there needs to be a <a href="key_keyword_login.html">login command</a> for one of the users in the show.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
In installations where Telnet is used to control a grandMA2 system, it might be a good idea to create a special user for the Telnet commands. Be aware that the telnet connection is case sensitive with the username and password.</div>

<p>After the login, any commands can be written to the system.</p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
Pay close attention when accessing the fixture setup and schedule from the telnet connection. It lock access for other users and there is no explaining warning.</div>
