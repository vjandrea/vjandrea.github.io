		<h1>Create an appointment in the agenda</h1>
		
		<p>To create an appointment in the agenda, tap on a date in the Agenda window. To get to the <strong>Agenda window</strong>, see the <a href="key_agenda_what_is.html">What is agenda</a> topic.</p>

<p>The Agenda window will now change, and it could look like this:</p>

<figcaption><em>Agenda appointment window</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the left side of the window, 4 new buttons become visible:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add - will add a new appointment to the schedule</li>
	<li>Delete - will delete the highlighted appointment</li>
	<li>Edit - will edit the highlighted appointment</li>
	<li>​Test - will test the CMD in the highlighted appointment</li>
</ul>

<p>When adding a new appointment, it is possible to fill in 8&nbsp;fields. Tap on the fields to edit them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Start</h2>

<p>The field Start handles what time the appointment should start. This could be at an exact time (Absolute) or it could be set to Dawn, Sunrise, Sunset or Dusk according to the time and place the console is set to.</p>

<p>For more information about time and place, see the <a href="key_date_time.html">Date &amp; time</a>&nbsp;topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>If the Start field is set to Absolute, then it is possible to enter a specific time for the appointment&nbsp;by using the&nbsp;Calculator in the Time field.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>The Duration field will manage how long time the appointment is active. For most commands, this is not relevant. It has to be at least 1 second.</p>

<div class="tip">Hint:<br />
It is not possible to make a duration on a flash button. It will take a Flash Off command to turn it off.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Repeat</h2>

<p>This field will manage how often the appointment will be repeated. Tap on the field and a pop-up will appear with different options:</p>

<p>For more information about commands and keywords, see the <a href="key_command_syntax_and_keywords.html">Command Syntax and Keywords</a>&nbsp;topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>First</h2>

<p>This is the first day the appointment will be executed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Last</h2>

<p>This is the last day the appointment will be executed.</p>
