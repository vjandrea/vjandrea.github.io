		<h1>Network systems</h1>
		
		<p>When more devices are connected with each other in a session, then it is a networked system.</p>

<p>There are so many possible combinations that it does not make sense to try and list them all.</p>

<p>The smallest network system is a computer with onPC running a session and connected to a MA 2Port Node onPC 1K.</p>

<p>Most systems have 1 console with 1 backup console or onPC and some networked devices to output the DMX.</p>

<p>If the devices that translate Ethernet data to DMX are MA nodes, then the DMX output is in sync, no matter where the DMX is output. So a blackout cue on LED fixtures is in sync when some LEDs got signal from the Console and some LEDs from a node somewhere in the system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all network systems, you have one console or onPC that is the session master. This is the one that is in charge of the communication and the one that is executing commands triggered by remote inputs or from a command in a sequence.</p>

<p>It is recommended to use a good network switch when connecting different devices.</p>

<p>Besides the consoles, there are a lot of different devices that can be added to the system.</p>

<p>Read the sub topics to get a short explanation of the different devices.</p>
