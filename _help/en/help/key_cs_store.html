		<h1>Storing cues</h1>
		
		<p>Storing cues is actually quite simple.</p>

<p>Simply press the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> key and then one of the executor buttons where you want to store.</p>

<p>There are of course more details to storing, so please keep reading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store a new cue on an empty Executor</h2>

<p>If you store a cue on an empty executor then the grandMA2 software automatically stores the cue in a new sequence and assigns this sequence to the executor using the default settings.</p>

<p>Going back to the example in the top of this topic: just pressing the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> key and then an executor button on the empty executor is enough. The software assumes that you are storing a cue.</p>

<p>This will automatically be cue number 1 - nothing else was specified.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Storing cues obeys Worlds and Filters. This enables a control of what is stored. Filters and Worlds can also be assigned to the sequence. This will function as an input filter allowing only the elements in the worlds and filters to be stored in the sequence.</p>

<p>Read more about then in the <a href="key_wfm_world_filter_mask.html">World, Filters, and Mask section</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cue numbers</h2>

<p>When a cue is stored, it is possible to specify a cue number. This is done using the following syntax: <span class="syntax">Store Cue [cue number]</span>. It is also possible to specify a sequence or an executor, using the keys in the command section, while storing:<br />
<span class="syntax">Store Cue [cue number] Sequence [sequence number]</span> or<br />
<span class="syntax">Store Cue [cue number] Executor [executor number]</span>.</p>

<p>Notice that the cues are stored in the sequence, but using the executor number will store the cue into the sequence assigned to that executor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cue numbers have three decimal numbers. If all are zero then they are not displayed. But cue number "42" is the same as cue number "42.000" - it is not "42 thousand", it is "42 point 0 0 0".&nbsp; The currently highest cue number that can be stored is "9 999.999". The lowest number that can be stored is "0.001".</p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
Storing nearly 10 000 000 cues will completely fill the memory and make the show file VERY big.<br />
The software will cancel the store process before the system crashes, but almost any operation after this will make the software shutdown!!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The software hide the trailing decimal zeros, but they are still there. This means that cue "5.2" is after cue "5.11" because they are actually cue "5.200" and "5.110".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not limited to only store a single cue number at a time. It can just as easily be a range of numbers - this means that it is possible to use <span class="hardkey">Thru</span>, <span class="hardkey">+</span>, and <span class="hardkey">-</span> keys to create number ranges to be stored.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are going to be working with or adding a lot of cues to the same sequence, then it can be a good idea to select the executor with the sequence.</p>

<p>This can be done by pressing the <span class="hardkey">Select</span> key and then one of the keys associated with the executor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store the second cue</h2>

<p>If the store function is used again on the same executor - without adding cue number details - then the grandMA2 does not know what is wanted and a pop-up appears giving the different choices.</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_choose-store-method_second-cue_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Choose store method pop-up with second cue option</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The right most button is called <span class="softkey">Create Second Cue</span> - tapping this will store a cue with the next whole number.</p>

<p>Over write and the two merge options are explained below. Remove and Release are covered in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store into cues that are not empty</h2>

<p>If the store operation is used to store into already existing cues then a pop-up like this appears:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_choose-store-method_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Choose store method pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It only appears if you have not specified what should happen. Have a look at the <a href="key_cs_store_options_default.html">Store Options and Defaults topic</a> for information about specifying this while storing.</p>

<p>"Cue Only", "Tracking Shield", "Remove", and "Release" are described in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>.</p>

<p>The three relevant options are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Overwrite:</strong><br />
	This will remove what is already stored in the cue and only store the new values.</li>
	<li><strong>Merge:</strong><br />
	This will merge the new values into the existing values. New values has a higher priority and will overwrite existing values.</li>
	<li><strong>Status Merge:</strong><br />
	This will do a merge of the new values, but will also store any values from the actual cues in the selected executor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>In the following examples we have a cue list with the following two cues (looking at the Sequence Tracking Sheet - read about it <a href="key_cs_cue_content.html#tracking_sheet">here</a>):</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_two-cues-before-merge_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cues before any store action</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now we turn on fixture 3 at 100 % an store this into cue 2.</p>

<p>This is the result if "Overwrite" is chosen:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_two-cues-after-overwrite_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cues after an Overwrite store action</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now fixture 2 is gone. This is because it only had values stored in cue number 2.</p>

<p>If we had chosen "Merge" instead it would have looked like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_two-cues-after-merge_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cues after a Merge store action</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now the values from fixture 3 is added to the existing values.</p>

<p>"Status Merge" had resulted in this if cue 1 or 2 is active and the executor is selected:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_two-cues-after-status-merge_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cues after a Status Merge store action</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The (tracked) value from fixture 1 is stored into cue 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store cues with timings</h2>

<p>When storing a cue it is possible to also store the different cue timings. This is described in details the <a href="key_cs_cue_timings.html">Cue Timings topic</a>, but here is the short version.</p>

<p>The <span class="hardkey">Fade</span> key will add different timing keywords to the command when storing.</p>

<p>For instance storing cue 4 with a fade time of 6 seconds and a delay of 1 second, the following keys can be pressed:</p>

<p><span class="hardkey">Store</span> <span class="hardkey">Cue</span> <span class="hardkey">4</span> <span class="hardkey">Time</span> <span class="hardkey">6</span> <span class="hardkey">Time</span> <span class="hardkey">Time</span> <span class="hardkey">1</span> <span class="hardkey">Please</span></p>

<p>This is the result in the command line feedback:</p>

<div class="cl_response">[time] : Executing : Store Cue 4 Fade 6 Delay 1</div>

<p>Pressing the <span class="hardkey">Fade</span> repeatedly will change what timing it adds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Adding and using Cue Labels</h2>

<p>A cue can be given a name - called label - while it is stored. This is the syntax: <span class="syntax">Store Cue [cue number] "my cue name"</span>.</p>

<p>The keyboard is needed for writing this. You need to write the quotation marks to tell the software that this is text - then it is not interpreted as a command.</p>

<p>Labels can also automatically be numerated while storing. Have a look at this command:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; store cue 2 + 4 "BO Scene 1"</div>

<p>This will not label both cue 2 and 4 the same - it will add 1 to the number for each cue. The result is that cue 2 is called "BO Scene 1" and cue 4 is "BO Scene 2". This enumeration only works if the number is the last part of the label and if there is a space between the last word and number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cue labels can be used when storing. This means that if there are several cues whose labels starts with "BO", then it is possible to store into all these cues in one operation using BO plus an asterisk. See the following example.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This is the cue sequence and content before storing</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_five-cues-before-storing_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cues before storing</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With an active value of 100% for fixture 1, we use the keyboard to type the following command:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; store cue "BO*" /merge /cueonly</div>

<p>This is the result:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_five-cues-after-storing_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cue after storing using names</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The two cues whose label begins with BO now got the new value - it was stored as Cue Only.</p>

<p>See more details about the command at the end of this topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store cue parts</h2>

<p>Besides the almost 10 million cues that could be stored in each sequence, if there was enough memory, it is also possible to store 199 cue parts to each cue.</p>

<p>Cue parts are a division of the "main" cue. The "main" cue is actually part 0 (zero). The first part that can be stored is number 1.</p>

<p>A value can only be in one of the parts. Have a look at this example from the Sequence Tracking Sheet:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-tracking-sheet_two-cues-with-part_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Cue 2 part 2 only containing fixture 3</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notice that the value for fixture 3 is stored in cue 2 part 1. It does not have a value in cue 2 part 0 (the main cue). And the values from fixture 1 and 2 are in the main cue and therefor do not have any value in cue 2 part 1.</p>

<p>Storing something in a part is almost as easy as storing the main cue. Using the example above the key presses would be:</p>

<p><span class="hardkey">Store</span> <span class="hardkey">Cue</span> <span class="hardkey">2</span> <span class="hardkey">Cue</span> <span class="hardkey">1</span> <span class="hardkey">Please</span></p>

<p>The second press on the cue key will result in the <a href="key_keyword_part.html">Part keyword</a> and the command line feedback looks like this:</p>

<div class="cl_response">[time] : Executing : Store Cue 2 Part 1</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Using command line input to add more while storing</h2>

<p>In the example using the cue labels to store, there was a command that showed some of the other possibilities while storing cues.</p>

<p>The command line gives access to all the store options that can be found in the GUI Store Options - read about then in the <a href="key_cs_store_options_default.html">Store Options and Defaults topic</a>.</p>

<p>All the different elements are described in the <a href="key_keyword_store.html">Store Keyword topic</a>.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following is just a few extra command line examples showing some of the possibilities while storing.</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Store Cue 1.2 Executor 1.4</div>

<p>Stores cue number 1.2 in the sequence assigned to executor 4 on executor page 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Store Sequence 8 Cue 20 /overwrite</div>

<p>Short version:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; S Seq 8 Cu 20 /o</div>

<p>Stores cue number 20 in sequence number 8 using the overwrite function. It does not matter if you write sequence or cue first. So this could also have been:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Store Cue 20 Sequence 8 /overwrite</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Store Cue 42 "Return of the Paranoid Android" /merge /use=Look</div>

<p>This will store the cue with a name and it is merged but it is also stored with the "Look" option. Read more about the store options including Look in the next topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="store_remove" name="store_remove"></a>Store Remove</h2>

<p>A version of storing is the Store Remove, where the <span class="softkey">Remove</span> button is selected in the Store pop-up (described above).</p>

<p>This will remove the stored values for the attributes that currently have active values in the programmer.</p>

<p>The values in the programmer is irrelevant&nbsp;in this case. They are simply an indicator of what attributes you want to remove from the cue.</p>

<p>For removal of a few values, the Sequence Tracking Sheet or Sequence Content Sheets might be good tools. Read about them in the <a href="key_cs_cue_content.html">Looking at the Cue Content topic</a>. &nbsp;</p>
