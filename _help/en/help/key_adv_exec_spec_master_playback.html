		<h1>Playback Masters</h1>
		
		<p>It is possible to a assign 50 different Playback Masters to fader executors.</p>

<p>The Playback Masters can be assigned to sequence executors. They function as a sub-master for the assigned sequence executors.</p>

<p>If a Playback Master is assigned then the small representation of the fader level in the Mini Executor will be split in two. It could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/img_mini-executor_sequence_playback-master_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Executor with a Playback Master</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The left of the two fader representations are the fader for the local executor. The right representation is the level of the Playback Master.</p>
