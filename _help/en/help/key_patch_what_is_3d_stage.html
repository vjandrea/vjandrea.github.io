		<h1>What is 3D and Stage setup</h1>
		
		<p>The grandMA2 have a virtual 3D space. In this space are all the patched fixtures and there position. The 3D space can also have other objects and elements. This could be a model of your venue and the set.</p>

<p>There are generally two ways to see this 3D space. In the grandMA2 software and in the MA 3D visualizer running on a windows computer.</p>

<p>Both of these are linked and display the information stored in the show file. It only makes sense to use these if you take the time to <a href="key_patch_position_fixtures.html">arrange your virtual fixtures according to the real world locations</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the grandMA2 software you can see a very simplified version of the 3D space. This can be seen in the <a href="key_patch_stage.html">Stage Window</a>.</p>

<p>In this view you'll see a simple wireframe model with the light from the fixtures just visualized as a single line showing the direction, intensity and color.</p>

<p>Each fixture is represented by a box and all 3D elements are also represented by simple boxes.</p>

<p>The in-build 3D Stage Window is a useful tool during programming and can be a big help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the MA 3D visualizer you can have a more realistic display of what the fixtures are doing and what our 3D model look like. The software is free and can be downloaded from MA Lightings webpage.</p>

<p>It runs on a windows computer connected the same network as your console or onPC. If you have a good computer, then you can run both grandMA2 onPC and MA 3D on the same computer.</p>

<p>You will need to have a <a href="key_network_session.html">session running</a> on the console/onPC and then you invite the MA 3D into your session. Besides getting the patch and fixture position from the show it also allows you to select a user. If you select the same user for the 3D as the one you are using on the console /onPC then the 3D will follow you if you use the Blind or Preview functions. This can be really useful if you need to change something in your programming in a live onsite situation.</p>

<p>The main idea behind the MA 3D is for pre-programming a show. It allows you to visualize and program your entire show without the need for all the MA hardware you might need onsite. You can download both grandMA2 onPC and MA 3D for free and start programming a show with the maximum amount of parameters. It is first when you need to output all these parameters to real world fixtures, that you need real MA hardware.</p>
