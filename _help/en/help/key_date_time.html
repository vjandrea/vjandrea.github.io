		<h1>Date &amp; time</h1>
		
		<p>Sometimes the console needs to know the current date and time, and sometimes also the location of the console. These settings are important&nbsp;if an <strong>Agenda</strong> is used. For more information, read the <strong><a href="key_agenda.html">Agenda</a></strong> topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The date and time settings are located in the&nbsp;<strong>Setup I Console I Date &amp; Time</strong>.</p>

<h2>Date and time</h2>

<p>To adjust the date and time, tap the green squares with hour, minute, second, day, month or year. This will open a calculator where it is possible to enter the current value.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
If the console is connected to an&nbsp;NTP&nbsp;server or a GPS, the date and time will be synchronized from the server or maybe the GPS and it will not be possible to set these manually. Read more about NTP server and GPS below.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2>Location</h2>

<p>In the <strong>Location</strong> tab, it is possible to enter the current timezone and the current longitude and latitude.</p>

<p>The Timezone&nbsp;refers to international standard GMT or UTC. Tap the green square and a calculator appears. Enter the current timezone, for example +1 for Central Europe, -5 for New York or +3 for Moscow.</p>

<p>It is also possible to enter the current location by tapping the green squares at Longitude and Latitude. The default position&nbsp;(9.94 - 49.79) is the center of Würzburg in Germany.</p>

<p>If the longitude is above zero, the position is north of the equator, and if it is below zero, the position will be placed on the&nbsp;southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>If the latitude is above zero, the position will be east of Greenwich (London) and if it is below zero, the position will be west of Greenwich.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Daylight Saving</h2>

<p>Daylight Saving is the practice of setting the clocks forward 1 hour from standard time during the summer months, and back again in the fall, in order to make better use of natural daylight.​</p>

<p>Use the green squares to set the day, month and time where the daylight saving starts and stops.</p>

<p>To enable or disable daylight saving, tap <span class="softkey">Daylight Saving Enable</span>.</p>

<hr />
<h2>NTP</h2>

<p>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization. There are NTP servers all over the world, and it is a good idea to find a server in the local area.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
To use this function, a station with internet connection (onPC) or connection to an&nbsp;NTP server must be in the session.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tap <span class="softkey">NTP info</span> and a pop-up appears.</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_ntp_info_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>NTP&nbsp;info pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The steps to let all of the consoles in the session synchronize&nbsp;to a NTP server. This has to be done on a station with a connection to the NTP&nbsp;server:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Tap the green field and type in the IP-address of the NTP server</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="softkey">Sync with NTP</span>, until it shows <strong>Enable</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>A note in the bottom of the pop-up labeled&nbsp;<strong>NTP&nbsp;server found: Received Time stamp</strong> appears, when there is a connection to the server.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
The IP address on the image above is the NTP server on VirginiaTech&nbsp;University, connected by an&nbsp;onPC with a internet connection.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2>Daylight info</h2>

<p>To get information about Sunrise, Sunset, Dusk and Dawn according to the position&nbsp;or timezone, tap <span class="softkey">Daylight Info</span>.</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_daylight_info_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Daylight info pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are the times the <strong>Agenda</strong> uses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2>GPS</h2>

<p>Tap GPS to open the GPS pop-up</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
To use the GPS function, an&nbsp;NMEA&nbsp;0183 (4800/8-N-1) USB GPS receiver has to be connected.</div>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_gps-info_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>GPS info pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To use a GPS on the system do as followed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Connect the GPS to one of the USB ports</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="softkey">GPS</span> until it is labeled&nbsp;Enable</li>
	<li>[Optional] Tap <span class="softkey">Sync with GPS</span> to synchronize the system time with the GPS UTC time. Tap until it is labeled Enabled. Then, it is not possible to set the time manually.</li>
	<li>[Optional] Tap <span class="softkey">Timezone</span>&nbsp;until it is labeled <strong>Auto</strong>, to let the GPS manage the timezones. Then, it is not possible to set the timezone manually.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>The GPS Master refers to the console, were the GPS is connected.</p>
