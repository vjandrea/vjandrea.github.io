		<h1>Multipatching</h1>
		
		<p>Multipatching is a function to add extra fixtures to a Fixture ID or Channel ID.</p>

<p>Any extra fixture needs its own DMX patch.</p>

<p>Adding multipatch fixtures to the fixture schedule will also add an extra virtual fixture in the stage view and MA 3D.</p>

<p>It does not cost you any parameters to add multipatch fixtures.</p>

<p>You cannot program the multipatched fixtures individually. It is connected to the same ID as the primary fixture. All fixtures, the primary and the multipatched do the same.</p>

<p>Any programming that existed on the primary fixture are also outputted on the multipatched fixtures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first process using the GUI:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Press the <span class="hardkey">Setup</span> key and then the <span class="softkey">Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule</span> button.</li>
	<li>Select the layer and fixture you want to multipatch.</li>
	<li>In the lower right corner you will find a button called <span class="softkey">Create Multipatch</span> - tap it (if the fixture schedule is on screen 1 - and you are on a grandMA2 full-size or grandMA2 light console, then you can also press the <span class="hardkey">X20</span> key.</li>
	<li>This opens a calculator pop-up. Enter the amount of multipatched fixtures you want to add the the selected fixture. Confirm by tapping <span class="softkey">Please</span>.</li>
	<li>The extra fixtures now have their own line in the list. All the elements with a black background is non-editable.</li>
	<li>You can change the name and the 3D position and rotation of the extra fixtures.</li>
	<li>You can add the extra patch address to the extra fixtures.</li>
	<li>Exit the Fixture schedule and the setup, and change save your changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second GUI process involves live patching and the DMX sheet. <a href="key_patch_livepatch.html">Read about it here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the process using the command line:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Assign [DMX-list] At Fixture [Fixture ID]</div>

<p>Assigning a list of DMX addresses to an existing fixture will create as many multipatch fixtures to your fixture as the list.</p>

<p>You can do the same with Channel ID.</p>

<p>You do not need to type the "At".</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<p>Adding an extra multipatched fixture (address 2.1) to Fixture ID 101:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Assign DMX 2.1 At Fixture 101</div>

<p>Adding five multipatched fixtures (addresses 3.1 thru 3.5) to Fixture ID 201:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Assign DMX 3.1 Thru 3.5 Fixture 201</div>

<p>Short version:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; as dmx 3.1 t 3.5 f 201</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now you have multipatched fixtures.</p>

<p>For more about positioning the fixture in MA 3D or the Stage view, please have look at the <a href="key_patch_position_fixtures.html">Position fixtures in the 3D stage</a> topic.</p>
