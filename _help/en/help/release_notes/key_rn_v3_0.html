		<h2>Release Notes - Version 3.0</h2>

<p>grandMA2 - version 3.0.0.5</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>The MA-Net2 protocol has changed to support the MA 8Port Node devices. All MA devices need a new network streaming protocol with the 2.9 software. Once updated to the correlating version to grandMA2 v2.9, MA 2Port Nodes, MA 4Port Nodes, MA 8Port Nodes, MA NSP (Network Signal Processor), and the MA NDP (Network Dimmer Processor) will no longer work in a session with an older network streaming protocol (e.g. grandMA2 v2.8). Down-dating MA 2Port Nodes or MA NSP running in MA 4Port Node Mode to be v2.8 compatible is only possible via grandMA1 v 6.801. All other devices can be down-dated via USB or windows installer only.</li>
	<li>If you would like to update your dimMA system from any version below 7.x please contact your MA-dealer or MA directly for any update information. Should you be using grandMA2 together with our dimMA solutions, please get in touch with us, since a console update will now require a MA NDP update and vice versa. We are happy to assist you.</li>
	<li>The current versions of grandMA2 onPC and MA 3D require at least Windows® XP with Service Pack 3. Microsoft® .NET Framework (4.0) will be installed on your computer.</li>
	<li>Hints and known limitations can be found in the appendix at the end of this document.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release&nbsp; - Version 3.0.0.2</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New functions and features in detail:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Layout View</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>New "Edit selected" button in layout view setup mode encoder bar.</li>
		<li>New symbol feature settings:
		<ul>
			<li>"with dimmer" displays color and gobo in relation to current dimmer value.</li>
			<li>"Always" displays color and gobo disregarding current dimmer value. Dimmer value can be visualized separately via dimmer bar or dimmer value.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>As it is not allowed to have multiple items of the same fixture inside one layout, a pop-up will warn the user if he tries to change the fixture ID of one item to the fixture ID of another fixture already existing in the same layout.</li>
		<li>Support of direct action for objects capable of pool playbacks (sequences, effects) has been added.</li>
		<li>Running pool playbacks will be visualized as mini executor icons inside layout view when assigned to a layout.</li>
		<li>Sheet Cue Color settings has been added to layout view. User can choose whether to only display the cue colors of playbacks of the current user or the cue colors of all running playbacks.</li>
		<li>The "Please" hard-key of the Edit layout object dialog can be used to tab through "Add text", "ID" and "confirm" button.</li>
		<li>Layout object background, border and text color editor provides a "reset color" button which resets the background color to transparent, and the text as well as border color to white.</li>
		<li>An editable border color has been added for layout view text objects.</li>
		<li>Multiple image files can be imported into image pool simultaneously.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Stage View lasso selection respects the order of selection of lasso.</li>
	<li>"Follow mask" button has been added in Stage view.</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Pools </strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The frame color can be changed for each pool object by using the command-line command "Appearance" (3 times assign key) and touching a pool object. E.g.: Insert "Appearance Preset 1.5" and choose a color from the pop-up. Possible parameters for command "Appearance" are "r" (red), "g" (green), "b" (blue) or "h" (hue), "s" (saturation), "br" (brightness). Hue value ranges from 0 to 360, all other parameters have a value range between 0 and 100. E.g.: "Appearance Group 1 /h=180 /s=95 /br=100"</li>
		<li>A "Reset Colors" button has been added to pool options. It removes all individual frame colors of any object inside this pool.</li>
		<li>Frame colors can be copied from one object to another. E.g.: "Appearance group 10 through 15 at group 5" will copy frame color of group 5 to group 10 through 15.</li>
		<li>All pools have a sheet style in addition to the already known Icon mode</li>
		<li>Pools in sheet style mode can hide or show empty pool items.</li>
		<li>All Macro pool items show the red colored special symbols 'C' and 'T' when the 'CLI' or 'Timing' option is disabled.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Clock and Timer</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Timer pool containing stopwatch and countdown functionality has been implemented.</li>
		<li>Stopwatch
		<ul>
			<li>The Time unit of the stopwatch can be chosen.</li>
			<li>The effect of stopping and starting the stopwatch can be set to either continuing or restarting from zero.</li>
			<li>The start trigger can be set to link selected, not linked or link last go. When linked, the commands GO, GOTO, and TOP of the linked executor will start the stopwatch.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Countdown
		<ul>
			<li>When the countdown function is enabled, the following settings will be available (additionally to the stopwatch settings):</li>
			<li>The countdown can be set to any time between 1s and 24h</li>
			<li>The alert duration sets how long the pop-up will be seen. Zero means that the pop-up will stay until confirmed, any other timing will automatically close it.</li>
			<li>Additionally to the pop-up, the user can choose to get an audible alert when the countdown has run down.</li>
			<li>The alert range can be local (i.e. the alarm will only go off at one station) or global (i.e. the whole session will be notified). Be aware, Special Master Sound out has to be set above zero to hear countdown alarm sounds.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The command "Load from default" loads defaults from current user profile. The command "Save to default" saves the current settings as defaults to the current user profile.</li>
		<li>The Timer pool objects show the current time of the timer. The letter S stands for stopwatch, the letter C for countdown, the letter G for global alert and the letter L for local alert.</li>
		<li>The command-line commands GO, PAUSE, TOP and OFF Timer x can be used to start, stop, reset and switch off a timer.</li>
		<li>The Timer can be assigned to executor buttons, x-keys or view buttons.</li>
		<li>The current time of the timer can be assigned as timing of a cue by using the syntax "Assign fade $timer1 cue 1 please" or by pressing the buttons "Assign Time TimerPoolObject Cue 1 Please".</li>
		<li>All running timers are listed in off menu.</li>
		<li>The timer keyword can be accessed via hard-key: MA + Macro.</li>
		<li>Additional features of grandMA2 clock view.
		<ul>
			<li>A Date display has been added.</li>
			<li>Additional time and date formats.</li>
			<li>Adjustable Time offset for world clocks.</li>
			<li>In addition to system time, SMPTE and MIDI timecode, timers can be displayed as well. The clock can be linked to any timer by using the select timer setting.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Message Center</strong></p>

	<p>grandMA2 Message Center provides an overview as well as a history of status, warnings and alerts.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The status icons to the right of the command-line show current active warnings and alerts. Most of those icons can be hidden by using the message center options dialog. To open the options menu, touch the yellow ball of the Message Center Overview title bar. Critical alerts like power-loss cannot be hidden.</li>
		<li>All currently valid status symbols, including those that have been hidden, will be displayed as long as the MA hard-key is pressed.</li>
		<li>The message center overview can be accessed by pressing any of the message center icons in the command-line.</li>
		<li>The message center overview provides a list of all currently valid symbols, their description and the number of available detail messages. The "Show All" button will provide a list of all available symbols with description and number of new and archived messages.</li>
		<li>Touching any row inside the message center overview will open the detailed message history of this topic.</li>
		<li>All Message Center messages can be accessed and exported via command-line. Possible commands are "List messages", which will have all messages listed inside the command-line feedback, or "Export messages", which will export all messages into a XML file. The syntax can be filtered by using conditions, e.g. "List Messages /condition=alert" will only list all alert messages.</li>
		<li>A stylesheet has been added to the Messages export. Loading the exported messages.xml using any browser like Internet Explorer, Safari or firefox will display a sortable table of messages. The style folder containing the stylesheet will automatically be copied to the USB drive when messages are exported.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Search and Replace</strong></p>

	<p>The Search and Replace function can be used to search for fixtures, presets, values,... and replace these with other fixtures, presets, values,...</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong>SEARCH search_for_object [[AT] search_values] [IF search_in_object]</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>search_for_object can be any kind of object to search for, e.g.:
			<ul>
				<li>Fixture 1 thru 5</li>
				<li>Attribute "PAN"</li>
				<li>Fixture 2 Attribute "PAN" + "TILT"</li>
				<li>Preset 4.1</li>
				<li>Sequence 3</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>search_values could be:
			<ul>
				<li>Value 10 thru 20</li>
				<li>Fade 3 Thru 10</li>
				<li>Delay 15</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>search_in_objects can be any kind of object to be inspected, e.g.:
			<ul>
				<li>Sequence 2</li>
				<li>Executor 1 thru 30</li>
				<li>Preset 0.1 thru 0.100 ..to search for embedded presets or presets containing specific values</li>
				<li>Preset 4.1</li>
				<li>Sequence 3</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="warning">Be aware that searching for presets and effects is searching for fixtures using this preset or effect in presets, cues, and effects. It is not searching for values of this preset or effect.</div>
		</li>
		<li>Examples:
		<ul>
			<li>"Search Fixture 1" - lists all objects containing any Attribute of fixture 1</li>
			<li>"Search Effect 10 If Sequence Thru" - lists all sequences and cues referring to effect 10.</li>
			<li>"Search Fixture Thru At Fade 10 Thru 20 if Sequence Thru" - lists all sequences and cues containing individual fade times between 10 and 20 seconds.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>In order to search for e.g. all fixtures stored with a specific color, search results can be used as a filter for the next search. E.g.:
		<ul>
			<li>"Search Fixture Thru Attribute "ColorRGB1" At 100 If Sequence Thru" - All fixtures that have the attribute Red at 100 will be found.</li>
			<li>"Search Fixture Thru Attribute "ColorRGB2" At 0 If Searchresult" - All fixtures that have the attribute Red at 100 and the attribute Green at 0 will be found.</li>
			<li>"Search Fixture Thru Attribute "ColorRGB3" At 0 If Searchresult" - All fixtures that have the attribute Red at 100, the attribute Green at 0 and the attribute Blue at 0 will be found.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>REPLACE search_for_object WITH replace_with_object [IF search_in_object]</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Replace syntax is similar to search syntax. The additional part of the syntax starts by using the keyword WITH.</li>
			<li>
			<div class="warning">The Replace syntax can be used in two "modes", either replacing objects or values.</div>

			<div class="warning">The syntax "Replace search_for_object WITH" without adding a "replace_with_object" will delete the "search_for_object".</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Examples
		<ul>
			<li>"Replace Preset 3.1 With Preset 3.3 If Sequence 1" - Replaces Preset 3.1 with Preset 3.3 in any cue of sequence 1.</li>
			<li>"Replace Fixture 1 With Fixture 201 If Sequence 1 thru 10" - Replaces Fixture 1 with Fixture 201 in any cue of sequence 1 through 10.</li>
			<li>"Replace Fixture 1+2 With Fixture 2+1" - Exchanges Fixture 1 with Fixture 2 and vice versa in any preset, effect, cue, ... of the whole show file.</li>
			<li>"Replace Fixture 1 With If Sequence 1 thru 10" - Removes Fixture 1 from all cues of sequence 1 thru 10.</li>
			<li>"Replace Attribute "Tilt" Fade 5 with Fade 10" - The individual fade time of 5 seconds of attribute Tilt of any fixture will be replaced with fade time of 10.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Hard-key access to keywords:
		<ul>
			<li>Search - MA + Move</li>
			<li>Replace - 2x Move</li>
			<li>With - Move if Replace search_for_object is already written in the command line.</li>
			<li>SearchResult - MA + 2x Group</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>When Groups, Filters, Worlds, or Selections are used in search/replace commands, the channels or fixtures included are being searched or replaced. E.g.: If Group 1 contains fixture 1 through 5 the commands "Search Fixture 1 Thru 5" and "Search Group 1" are equivalent commands.</li>
		<li>The command "Searchresult Please" creates a "Search-result-world". This world will filter all Sheets and command lines according to the fixtures, channels and attributes of the current search-result. To exit this world, execute the command "World 1 Please" or select the World you were working with again.</li>
		<li>The command "Selfix Searchresult" selects all fixtures of the current search-result.</li>
		<li>It is highly recommended to use search and replace syntaxes inside Macros. The option /nc can be used to hide pop-ups and result windows when using search and replace.</li>
		<li>New predefined Macros for search and replace.
		<ul>
			<li>Replace Channels, Replace Fixtures</li>
			<li>Replace Channels In Sequence, Replace Fixtures In Sequence</li>
			<li>Replace Values for Channels, Replace Values for Fixtures</li>
			<li>Search Fixtures in Sequence</li>
			<li>Search Fixtures in Show file</li>
			<li>Search Presets</li>
			<li>Search Values in Sequences</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Patch and Fixture Schedule
		<ul>
			<li>Patch and fixture schedule and live setup Fixture Position dialog provides an encoder bar for position, scale and rotation having the same functionality as stage view encoder bar.</li>
			<li>The order of the patch and fixture schedule table is kept, even when leaving and re-entering setup.</li>
			<li>The Fixture type multi patch column includes a multi-patch index</li>
			<li>The Fixture Type editor has been enhanced: Now there is the possibility to apply a "Minimum DMX Fade Time" to the channel type to limit speed of DMX value change. The minimum DMX time describes the minimum fade time for changing from minimum to maximum DMX value. This setting can be used to limit the speed of the DMX value change of a scroller in order to avoid for instance gel string breaks.</li>
			<li>Fixtures and Channels that are not included in the currently selected World cannot be manipulated inside Live Setup any more.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Remote Input Setup
		<ul>
			<li>An input monitor can be displayed at the bottom of the Midi and analog remote dialog to check incoming midi and analog remote signals. The Toggling title bar Info button will toggle the input monitor.</li>
			<li>The button "CLI" has been renamed to "CLI on Master" as remote inputs are always executed at the master console.</li>
			<li>Setup / Show / Remote Inputs Setup: The selection type "Current" has been renamed in "Current Page on Master" to better describe its functionality.</li>
			<li>Setup / Show / Remote Inputs Setup: Name and Info can be added to each remote input.</li>
			<li>The Midi note input signals can be offset by any value between -1023 and +1023 for each individual station inside the network config dialog.</li>
			<li>The "Analogue Remotes" input can be offset by any value between 0 and + 48 for each individual station inside the network config dialog. This offset can be defined in the column "Analog Offset" and will be added to the incoming Analog channels. E.g.: If the offset entry is 16, channel 1 becomes channel 17 for this desk, channel 2 becomes 18 and so on. In the column "Midi Offset" the Midi Notes can be adjusted corresponding to the offset.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Auto Create
		<ul>
			<li>To automatically generate color presets for fixtures with Mixcolor attributes there is the new tab "Additional Presets" . In the upper section there are 2 input fields to determine the number of presets to be generated. The entry in the field "Amount Hue" determines how many different color values are generated out of the "Hue"-scale . The entry in the field "Amount Saturation" determines how many different color saturation shades are to be generated . The selection from the field "Use" decides of which Mixcolor attributes the presets are created. If "all Mixcolor" is selected, those color attributes are preferred for each fixture type which are not RGB. For example, having a RGBA fixture means that the amber LED is mainly used to create different tones of orange color. When the "Encoder Grouping" button is turned on additionally supplemental color channels, such as the color wheel "Color1" with the default value (open), whilst the presets are generated, the default value will be added to the presets (i.e. the corresponding color attributes are added to the Encoder grouping of the Mixcolor attributes). The "Add global Mixcolor " button creates individual global presets for each selected fixture type on the left side. The "Merge global Mixcolor " button creates common global presets for all selected fixture types on the left side at a time. The generated presets will have the name of their H (Hue) and S (Saturation) values .</li>
			<li>Auto-create additional presets: Color presets can be created from swatch book. One or multiple colors can be selected by using lasso or pressing CTRL and touching elements of the swatch book. The auto generated name can be set to be the name of the color, the colorkey or both.</li>
			<li>There is a new swatch book called "MA predefined colors" which contains 13 basic colors.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Software Update
		<ul>
			<li>Update Software via Network: Separate tabs have been added for every station type in addition to the already existing all tab.</li>
			<li>Update SW via Network: A menu to select a folder containing update files from USB drive(Console) or from any drive (onPC) has been added. Be aware that the folder is not allowed to contain multiple version of the same update file, but only one file per station type.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The Disable Blind Button functionality of /Setup/User/Gandmaster + B.O. etc. has been extended. Possible settings are: "Disabled" = Button is disabled, "Blind Edit only" = Button can only edit the blind mode by being pressed for a long time, "Enabled" = Button can be used for blind by being shortly pressed and can edit blind mode by being pressed for a long time.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Network troubleshooting tools </strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The new command "networkspeedtest" checks the current network performance of any detected grandMA2 consoles, grandMA2 onPC, MA NPUs, MA VPUs and MA 3D devices. Attention: This will block all other network traffic and DMX Traffic for some seconds - don't use it in show situations!</li>
		<li>After having finished the network speed-test, a pop-up shows all stations with their IP address. The column "time" shows the relation data rate against time. In a 1000Mbit network the value for a console should usually be 0.1. The column "sequence errors" shows how much packets have been sent out of order. "Packets received" shows the percentage of correctly delivered packages. In a 1000Mbit network this value should be 100%. If this is not the case, the reason could be a bad network connection or an overloaded device.</li>
		<li>There is an IP collision detection in the system monitors of all other connected consoles which are not participants of this IP conflict.</li>
		<li>The speed of the first network adapter of consoles and NPUs can be changed via the commands "SetNetworkSpeed 100 x" and "SetNetworkSpeed 1000 x". x stands for the last block of the IP address . ATTN: Devices must be rebooted !</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Sequence and Executor </strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Cue or Part Cue row background color can be adjusted by
		<ul>
			<li>using the command-line command "Appearance" (3 times assign key). E.g.: Insert "Appearance Cue 1" and choose a color from the pop-up. Possible parameters for the command Appearance are "r" (red), "g" (green), "b" (blue) or "h" (hue), "s" (saturation), "br" (brightness). The hue value range is 0 through 360, all other parameters have a value range between 0 and 100. E.g.: Appearance Cue 1 /h=180 /s=95 /br=100</li>
			<li>using the Edit color button inside the edit cue number dialog.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The new Sequence Executor sheet option Cue Color Column has been added to choose columns to display any individual cue background color.</li>
		<li>New buttons for fast access to Edit Next Cue, Edit Previous Cue and Edit Current Cue in Edit Sequence pop-up have been added.</li>
		<li>Pressing and holding MA+Goto and pressing executor buttons executes "Load Next" at each pressed executor button until releasing MA+Goto</li>
		<li>The Edit sequence pop-up provides the same command-line interaction as the sequence executor sheet. E.g.: Store, Update, Delete and touch a cue row will execute the referring command.</li>
		<li>The text of the Edit sequence executor title bar shows the Page, Executor and Sequence ID.</li>
		<li>The Tracking Sheet can be sorted by Channel ID or Fixture ID.</li>
		<li>The Tracking Sheet edit values calculator supports relative values in addition to absolute values. E.g.: multiply current value by 2: *2</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Presets </strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>A Dynamic preset pool has been implemented. The user can create Basic Window, Presets or Dynamic. This pool is linked to the current type of preset of the encoder bar.</li>
		<li>The auto-naming of color presets when being stored as new presets has been added.</li>
		<li>The auto-naming of dimmer and gobo presets when being stored as new presets has been added.</li>
		<li>All auto-named presets will be marked with the special sign "#" in the end. This sign is not a part of the preset name. When updating an auto-named preset, the name will also be updated.</li>
		<li>Effect layer values can be stored inside Presets. When knocked in programmer or stored inside cues, the presets will be used as templates which are not linked to those presets anymore.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Command-line </strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Macros can trigger Macros. Triggering Macro B from Macro A will result in Macro A waiting for Macro B to finish before continuing with the next Macro Line of Macro A.</li>
		<li>The possibility to move DMX universes inside the Universe pool, directly or via command-line, has been implemented. E.g. <strong>Move DMXUniverse 2 at 5</strong></li>
		<li>The command-line now supports multiple wildcards (*), even in combination with dots in between. E.g. <strong>Delete Preset *.*</strong> deletes all presets of all Presettypes.</li>
		<li>There are new parameters for the DeleteShow command: <strong>Deleteshow /b</strong> deletes .backup files only. - <strong>Deleteshow /s</strong> deletes .show.gz files only.</li>
		<li>Addressing executors via command-line has been improved to provide support for calling by name or number.
		<div class="warning">All existing cue links and Macros of show files stored with former grandMA2 versions will be converted as far as possible. Please check cue links and Macros of existing shows when loading them the first time with this version. Some cue links and Macros may have to be adjusted.</div>

		<ul>
			<li>Go Exec "exec name" - start executor with specified name on current page</li>
			<li>Go Exec "exec number" - start executor with specified number on current page</li>
			<li>Go Exec "*"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on all pages</li>
			<li>Go Exec "*"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on all pages</li>
			<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
			<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
			<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
			<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This can also be used to store to specific executors, sequences or cues by name instead of number.</p>
		</li>
		<li>New command: <strong>List Attribute thru</strong> will display all available attributes in the command-line feedback menu. This command also exists as a predefined macro.
		<div class="warning">If new fixture types are included in the show the list will be restructured</div>
		</li>
		<li>Every Channel / Fixtures keyword can be combined with any Attribute keyword. E.g.: <strong>Fixture 1 Attribute "Pan" at 20</strong> sets Attribute Pan of Fixture 1 at 20 or <strong>Park Attribute "Tilt"</strong> parks the Tilt values of the current selection. Correct naming of attributes can be checked by using the "List Attribute thru" command.</li>
		<li>System variables have been added. These variables can be referred to inside Macros or when using command-line syntax. Predefined Macros like "Off Page minus current" are already using these variables. Available variables are e.g.
		<ul>

	<p><strong>CITP MSEX video streams</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The CITP video viewer window can be used to view CITP MSEX video streams of MA VPU and third party media servers at the desk.</li>
		<li>The Setup CITP menu title bar shows the current CITP multicast address. This address can be changed. Changing this address changes the CITP multicast address for all MA stations (consoles, MA 3D, MA VPU) in the current session. Be aware that after having changed this address, the connection to third party CITP stations might not be possible anymore.</li>
		<li>The compression quality of CITP video streams can be chosen per session inside the CITP Network Configuration menu.</li>
		<li>The CITP Video streams have been tested with versions of the following media servers: MA VPU, Green Hippo Hippotizer, PRG MBOX, Arkaos MediaMaster, Coolux Desktop Streamer.</li>
		<li>The CITP video and thumbnail compression format can be changed in the options menu of the CITP Network Config Yellow Ball.</li>
		<li>
		<div class="warning">A CITP connection is not possible when running CITP sender and CITP receiver at the same computer.</div>

		<div class="warning">The CITP Multicast address can be configured by pressing the title bar button in the CITP Network Configuration menu. The CITP Multicast address 224.0.0.180 is not forwarded by many switches as soon as IGMP Snooping is enabled. The CITP Multicast address of MA products can be switched to 239.224.0.180 in order to use CITP in combination with IGMP Snooping. Be aware that the alternative multicast address 239.224.0.180 is not yet supported by many other media server manufacturers. Please check the compatibility with the manufacturer of your media server prior to changing the CITP Multicast address and enabling the IGMP Snooping while using CITP.</div>

		<div class="warning">Streaming videos via network needs bandwidth. A single CITP video stream of 30fps generates up to 15Mbit/s. Video streams are sent as multicast. Requesting the same video stream from different grandMA2 consoles or MA 3Ds will not generate additional network traffic.
		<p>Some hints to keep network stability when using CITP:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The list below gives a brief overview over the data rate of one 30 Frames per second CITP video stream. When having compressed streams, the data rate varies depending on the compressibility of the video content.
			<ul>
				<li>Uncompressed RGB8 stream: 15Mbit/s</li>
				<li>PNG compressed stream: 7Mbit/s up to 15Mbit/s depending on video content.</li>
				<li>JPG compressed stream: 1Mbit/s up to 8Mbit/s depending on video content.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The minimum network speed is 1000MBit/s. Do not enable CITP in an 100Mbit/s network environment.</li>
			<li>The maximum amount of CITP network data rate should not exceed 30Mbit/s per physical network. When exceeding this limit, reduce the video stream quality by choosing a higher compression (jpg) or request less different video streams. Otherwise visualizers and video stream viewers running at computers with installed operating system Microsoft Windows may not receive all video stream data resulting in CITP video stream fps dropping below 1 fps.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="warning">The MA VPU CITP video streams frame rate is limited to 30fps shared by all requested outputs and 10fps shared by all requested layers of CITP video streams. E.g.: When requesting CITP video streams of Output1 and Output2, each stream will have a maximum refresh rate of 15 fps.</div>

		<div class="warning">The MA VPU reduces CITP video streams frame rate if the CITP network traffic of current connected network exceeds 30Mbit.</div>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<div class="warning">Inserting the command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers of fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">When multiple fixtures are selected with a lasso in the layout view, the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons are respected. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">The network switch IGMP Snooping functionality has to be switched off in order to be able to update MA 2Port Nodes.</div>

<div class="warning">A grandMA1 compatibility mode is no part of grandMA2 console software 3.0 and later. When grandMA1 compatibility mode is needed, grandMA2 consoles and MA NPUs have to be downdated to grandMA2 v2.9.1.1</div>

<div class="warning">Exec Time can be used for Executor buttons and Executor Faders. The new Executor option "Ignore Exec Time" has been added. When this option is enabled, the referring executor will use its own off time instead of the Exec Time Fader Timing. Show files stored with grandMA2 v2.9.1 and earlier will be converted. All Fader executors will have this option enabled. Executor option defaults are valid for fader and button executors. When storing new fader executors, these executors will listen to Exec Time by default.</div>

<div class="warning">Fixture type preset reference contains values only. It is not possible to add any fade, delay or effect data to fixture type preset references.</div>

<div class="warning">ASCII show import supports Strand, Transtechnik and ADB ASCII show files.</div>

<div class="warning">A CITP connection is not possible when running CITP sender and CITP receiver at the same computer.</div>

<div class="tip">Following syntax can be used to switch off faders only or buttons only of current page or of all pages except current page:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100</strong> - This switches off all Faders of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240</strong> - This switches off all Buttons of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100 Page Thru - $faderpage</strong> - This switches off all Faders of all pages except current.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240 Page Thru - $buttonpage</strong> - This switches off all Buttons of all pages except current.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip">Addressing executors via command-line has been improved to provide support for addressing by name or number. This can be used when sending playback commands to specific executors or when storing to a specific executor, sequence or cue for example. All existing cue links and Macros of show files stored with former grandMA2 versions will be converted as far as possible. Please check cue links and Macros of existing shows when loading them the first time with this version. Some cue links and Macros may have to be adjusted. When creating new Macros or cue links or editing existing ones, the new syntax as described below has to be used.
<ul>
	<li>Go Exec "exec name" - start executor with specified name on current page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "exec number" - start executor with specified number on current page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "*"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on all pages</li>
	<li>Go Exec "*"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on all pages</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>MA onPC command wing DMX input is supported for the ports "DMX In" and "DMX out A" only. The port "DMX out B" can only be used as DMX out!</li>
	<li>Up to now, the MA 4Port Nodes and the MA 8Port Nodes do not support the sACN protocol.</li>
	<li>Before loading show files stored with grandMA2 <strong>v2.7.x</strong> the first time with grandMA2 v2.9.x, attribute Colormix4 and 5 and Colordim4 and 5 of self-made fixture types have to be manually adjusted to fulfill the color specification. Amber has to be Colormix 4 invert or Colordim 4 without invert, and White has to be Colormix 5 invert or Colordim 5 without invert. Otherwise, color information of these fixture types will be lost after loading show file with v2.9.</li>
	<li>The Feature name for ColorDim/ColorMix has changed into MixColor. Macros using one of these feature names have to be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Known limitation when loading show files stored with <strong>v2.8.x</strong> for the first time in v2.9
	<ul>
		<li>Special Masters have a new data structure in grandMA2 software.
		<ul>
			<li>All Special Master custom labels will be reset to MA default labels</li>
			<li>Assignment of 100mm faders will be reset to default.</li>
			<li>Macros referring to special masters have to be adjusted and have to use the new naming and numbering of special masters.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Macros referring to relative values have to be adjusted according to new relative/absolute syntax.</li>
		<li>User profiles exported to USB drives have to be manually moved from folder importexport to user_profile folder in order to import these profiles using grandMA2 v2.9</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>MA 4Port Nodes and MA 8Port Nodes have to be updated to v1.0.9 or later to be compatible with grandMA2 v2.9. 2-Port Nodes have to be updated to 1.77 or later in order to be compatible to grandMA2 v2.9.</li>
	<li>Channelset labels of fixture types have to be unique to be visible and accessible in calculator. E.g.: If channel sets of Attribute Shutter are closed, open, open, open, only one open is visible in the calculator. Changing channel set labels to closed, open, open(2), open(3), will result in all channel sets being visible in the calculator.</li>
	<li>When using Agenda and astronomical clocks, grandMA1 and grandMA2 geographical position data input and calculation of astronomical clocks uses longitude coordinates with mixed up algebraic sign according to GPS standard coordinates. Workaround to get a correct astronomical clock until this bug is fixed is to invert the longitude coordinate of your current position to get the correct calculated times of sunset, dusk, dawn, and sunrise.</li>
	<li>Astronomical clock always calculates time according to standard time zone. Additional summer times are not recognized and cannot be adjusted manually when using sunset, dusk, dawn, and sunrise in the agenda.</li>
</ul>
