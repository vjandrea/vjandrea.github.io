<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>If you would like to update your dimMA system from any version below 6.x please contact your MA-dealer or MA direct for any update information. Should you be using grandMA2 in connection to our dimMA solutions, please get in touch with us, since a console update will now require a NDP update and vice versa. We are happy to assist you.</li>
	<li>The current versions of onPC and 3D require minimum Windows® XP with Service Pack 3 (Microsoft® .NET Framework (4.0) will be installed on your computer, if not already installed).</li>
	<li>With Version 2.5.70 the default speed of effects and the rate of effect lines has been exchanged by a single speed per line. Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugfix Release - Version 2.5.70.6</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fixed Bugs and improved functionality</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sequence Executor Sheets do not lose their scroll position any more when updating a cue.</li>
	<li>Knock in bug has been fixed. Store mode all and store mode all for selected work as expected now.</li>
	<li>Missing Reset of the Store bar filter has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Channel sheet columns are resized correctly again when resizing the channel sheet.</li>
	<li>Colordim fixtures with a real master dimmer are visualized correctly at the 3D and Stage view.</li>
	<li>Command line default is not changed when hitting update.</li>
	<li>Preset symbols display has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Effects running from HTP executors can be stomped.</li>
	<li>Effect off time calculation bug has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Very fast running chasers do not blip the DMX universes any more.</li>
	<li>DMX remote triggering buttons threshold has been set to 128 instead of 255.</li>
	<li>Touch screen long press has been improved for sheets.</li>
	<li>Library subfixture spacing has been fixed for a huge amount of fixtures.</li>
	<li>Crash fixed, when using the command line to patch or unpatch fixtures.</li>
	<li>grandMA2 onPC resizing has been improved. The grandMA2 onPC will resize to the screen it has been started. The onPC only changes its size when started. If you move the onPC from one screen to another, you have to restart the onPC to resize it to the new resolution. The maximum resolution of the internal screens is 1280 x 800, the resolution of the external screens can be adjust at the onPC options when using multiscreen mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Release - Version 2.5.70</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fixed Bugs and improved functionality</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Command line</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>The command "update please" updates the current cue of the selected sequence obeying the settings of "Add new Content / Original Contents only" and "Tracking Update / Update Cue Only" (inside the Update menu). Using the command extension "Update (Cue) x" allows to update Cues not outputted at the moment. Accordingly pushing the hardkey "Update" an Executor Button does the same.</li>
		<li>Setup/Console/local settings/ "Exec CLI": When CLI (Command Line Interaction) for Executors is disabled a combination of the command line content with- with the exception of the selected Executor.</li>
		<li>Automatic MAtricks Single X and Y Reset: The current "Single X" and "Single Y" settings of the MAtricks will be reset if a fixture selection changes or gets canceled using "clear".</li>
		<li>The functionality of the commands "Stomp", "Release" and "Remove" for effects are brought into line. Using one of the above commands in combination with an effect will add the referring command to the programmer for attributes of current selection currently using this effect. "Stomp/Release/Remove Effect x", without having fixtures selected: Signs all attributes of Effect x with "Remove" set active into the programmer, to e.g. store/merge this into an existing Cue and thereby remove all such effect information.</li>
		<li>Implemented the "edit next/prev" functionality. With "Edit Please" the editing function for the selected sequence of the first Cue (when switched off), resp. for the current cue. "Edit Next" edits the next Cue - "Edit Prev" the previous one.</li>
		<li>Playback commands can be filtered by user profiles, e.g. "off page 1 /UPR=2" or "OFF EXEC 1 /userprofile="Gabi". Only the executors last used by User 2 (resp. "Gabi") will be considered.</li>
		<li>Using the command "info" with an object (Pool): Info property is listed in command line for: BMP, Effect, Fade Path, Filter, Fixture, Fixture Layer, Fixture Type, Form, Group, Macro, Master, MATrix, Page, Preset, Sequence, Time Code, User, User Profile and View.</li>
		<li>Workflow using the decimal keyboard in the command line: "Channel 1 at 50". The selection will be executed right after keying in the channel / fixture (before an AT). This can be helpful in case e.g. channels shall be re-sorted in a view -&gt; actual values can be seen before changing them.</li>
		<li>New Commands: "CrashLogCopy", "CrashLogDelete", and "CrashLogList". The command "CrashLogCopy" copies existing Log files coming from a crash to the first recognized USB-Stick to the folder gma2/"temp". "CrashLogList" views such files in the "Command line Feedback" view. "CrashLogDelete" deletes them from the harddrive.</li>
		<li>The Show file History can be displayed in the "Command line Feedback" view. The command "List 1.1 thru" displays this show file information.</li>
		<li>Pages can be called with their names (alias): e.g. instead of typing "Page 1" the command "Page "Admission"" can be used. The names need to be typed in completely - no wildcards (*,…) are allowed.</li>
		<li>"Shuffle selection" works in combination with MAtricks.</li>
		<li>The executor buttons have new functions in the assign menue: "ToFull" and "ToZero". "ToFull" sets the master fader of an executor to100%, - "ToZero" to 0%. When "auto start" or. "auto stop" is active sequences and effects on this executor will be switched on/off as well,.</li>
		<li>Rate / Rategroups, Speed / Speedgroups can be used in the command line.e.g.. "Assign Specialmaster x at Effect y thru z". With the "List" command entries in the command feedback view can be executed. "List 19.1.1.1".</li>
		<li>When effect values are entered via the command line different attributes get the default adjustments "absolute/relative".</li>
		<li>Opening the calculator of an encoder it follows the "Program Time"</li>
		<li>Lock / unlock: Complete pools can be locked. Indicator is a yellow lock sign. If cues in a sequence are locked and the sequence will be deleted the locked cues remain existing. Indicator: red font colour.Lock / unlock follows oops. When trying to update locked cues, effects or presets, the update menu shows this with red font colour as well.</li>
		<li>Command "Selection" can be combined with "if".e.g.. "Store if Presettype Position if Selection" = only pan/tilt is stored for the current selection.</li>
		<li>Command "default" (keys "MA" and"." ) accepts filters.e.g. set only attribute position at default. "Default if Filter x" .</li>
		<li>"List function" (e.g. list 19.1.1.1) in the command feedback display uses more colors . green: changeable values (assign /speed=30). yellow: Assignable values (Assign Specialmaster 16 Effekt 1). red: unchangeable (locked ) values</li>
		<li>When executing Cue Mode "Release" will no more be break nor assert cues.</li>
		<li>New 0ption"overwrite all" in overwrite Popup when exporting- e.g.. "export Preset 0.1 thru /overwrite". ( similiar as "/noconfirm" before)</li>
		<li>The Fixture Button has a new function: 2 x press= "Selection"</li>
		<li>The Delete Button has new functionality: 2 x press = "Remove", 3 x press = "Release". This can be filtered with an IF as well. e.g.. Fixture 1 thru 5 are selected: "Remove if Presettype Position" = Write Pan and Tilt for the selected fixtures with remove into the programmer. These can be removed out of a sequence with a store/merge.</li>
		<li>Fixture and sequence views: Moving Attribute / Functions in the headline will insert them at the target position.</li>
		<li>New view (create Basic Window/ "Others") : Command Filter. The AT / Store Filter is shown permanently and visible.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Effects</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Effect Editor and Effect Line Editor: With "Take selection" in the Edit Effect menu the current selection in the selected effect lines will be taken as usual.With the new button "Take MAtricks" the "Block X", "Align Group X" and "Wing" adjustments will be taken from the current MATricks. With "Show selection" the selection and groups, blocks and wings are also taken into the MATricks. (If more than one sequence lines with different adjustment are selected the adjustments of the last selected are taken.</li>
		<li>New structure of effect speeds in effect editor:the "default effect speed" and the possibility to replace the start speed with a speed group has been completely taken out.The column "Rate Group" has been changed in "Speed Group". This enables to use a speed group or a rate group to each effect line.This is always active when using the effect in the programmer as well as storing the effect in a cue.The column"Rate" has been changed in"Speed". In the headline the unit is shown (Hz, BPM, Sek in Userprofil adjustable) and times can be directly entered. (If rate groups in older version were uses you will now find them in the speed group column). Also in channel, fixture and misc. views the layer "Rate" was exchanged with "Speed". That means that no more a factor can be entered , but the speed directly.In the command line speeds have tob e entered in Hz. If an effect which follows a speed group is stored in a sequence this effect can only be changed with the speed group -no longer with the speed fader of the sequence executor</li>
		<li>When starting an selective Effect in the Effectpool, only the Effect ID will be taken into the programmer ( not the rate ( now speed) anymore )</li>
		<li>New Mode Buttons in the "Running Effect" View. Is no mode selected, clicking an effect opens the corresponding encoder bar. Switching to the "Off Mode" or "Stomp Mode" , this action takes place on the afterwards selected effect.If "All Stomp" or "All Off" in single columns is selected, all Effects of a column will be switched off, or with "Stomp" taken into the programmer. Attention: "Off" in column "Sequence" switches off the complete sequence, in the column "Programmer" the effects will be taken out of the programmer.</li>
		<li>If "Link Feature" ( encoder bar ) is selected when creating an effect,it is possible with the command "at Form 19" (Circle) to add directly to both sub-forms the attributes pan and tilt e.g. for presettype position.This also works when in the special effect dialog more than one attributes are selected ( U-Keys) and a form with multiple subforms is selected.</li>
		<li>New button "Shuffle Selection" in Edit Effect menu. Works for currently selected effect lines. Shuffle Selection does not work for template effects(no Selection in Effect lines available).</li>
		<li>In Form Editor new button "Link Graphs" can combine 2 graphs - means they have a similar number of points in 2D Mode.</li>
		<li>Form Editor: editing a form with 2 Graphs in 2d Mode, "Load Predefined" gives new 2 dimensional form which are shown animated in the editor.</li>
		<li>New buttons in Assign menu: "Stepped Rate" and "Link Effect To Rate". Is "Stepped Rate" active, the rate fader does not work analog but discrete: 1:32, 1:16 , 1:8 , 1:4 , 1:2 ,1:1, 2:1 , 4:1 , 8:1 , 16:1, 32:1. Is "Link Effect To Rate" active, the rate fader does not only change the fade times of a cues but also the speed of effects in cues. Attention: This only works with effects not using speed groups.</li>
		<li>Rate Fader can be tapped with the "learn" Button. The "Stepped Rate" in the executor assign menu has to be switched on.</li>
		<li>Edit Effect Dialog: entering presets for "Low", "High", "Center" or "Size" will change the effect lines from "Relative" in "Absolute"</li>
		<li>Effect Editor : buttons which have temporarily no functionality are not displayed anymore e.g.. Effect has no selection (Temp. Effect).</li>
		<li>On/off times for Chaser/Effects and off times for Sequence - Toggle fade now via a virtual master.</li>
		<li>FAST_OFF - FAST_ON for Chaser and Effect</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Layout View</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Defaults for layout views can be stored now:. Setup / User / Defaults / Layout defaults. The new buttons "Save to default" and "load from default" in the caption bar of the layout view options will store / recall these settings. The size of new inserted fixtures and elements is corresponding to the values "Grid X" and "Grid Y". (a little bit smaller to have a distance).</li>
		<li>Circle arrangement in Layout view: Special behavior if angle sum is 360 degrees: Last element is at "next to last" position. Otherwise last element is at last position.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sheets</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking Sheet: Create Individual times (where there had only been default times).</li>
		<li>Tracking view: Tracked values can be changed directly.Selected Cells will be blocked automatically, when they are changed via middle mouse button or via edit button in option menu..With new "Edit Cue Only" button in the headline it can be choose whether the cells in the next cue are blocked as well so that the changed values will not be tracked. The editor can be opened with the mouse as well :press middle and right mouse button and then release right mouse button.</li>

<h2>Release - Version 2.5.3.6</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Main feature overview:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sheet Masks</li>
	<li>Filter</li>
	<li>Playback Filter</li>
	<li>grandMA Show Converter</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overview Worlds, filters, masks.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Worlds are containing a selection and an attribute filter. Calling a world filters all views and programmer access.</li>
	<li>The new attribute filter is replacing the former separated Store filter and At filter. This filter contains an attribute filter and a layer filter (Value, Value Times, Effects). This filter can be stored at the new filter pool. A filter from the pool can be used temporarily (calling the filter), permanent (selecting the filter) or together with If at the command line.</li>
	<li>Worlds and filters can be used as input filters for sequences and as playback worlds for executors.</li>
	<li>Masks provide wide variety combinations for masking sheets to display only fixtures and attributes following these criteria at a sheet. These masks can be stored at the new mask pool and can be assigned to any sheet.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New functions and features in detail</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The sheet masking has been revised and extended. The Feature Mask from previous versions has been improved and can be found by setting the right hand side of the new sheet mask options to: Show if in Saved Attributes, then pressing the 'Define Mask' button to choose what features or attributes to display.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Interactive Sheet Masking
	<ul>
		<li>Fixtures, Groups, Worlds, Filters, Masks, Presettypes ... can be assigned at sheet headlines to mask the current sheet to only show fixtures/attributes of the assigned object.</li>
		<li>Example: <span class="hardkey">Assign</span><span class="hardkey">Group</span><span class="hardkey">1</span> fixture sheet headline; the fixture sheet will display only fixtures of group 1.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Assigning an object to a sheet headline will be displayed by a red ghost. Any other active mask will be displayed by a orange ghost. Every sheet can only be masked by one mask at the same time. Using a set button or assigning a mask to the sheet headline will overwrite the local mask with the new settings.</li>
	<li>Sheet Masking
	<ul>
		<li>Sheets have a new sheet mask editor in the sheet options.
		<ul>
			<li>The <span class="hardkey">Show if</span>/<span class="hardkey">hide if</span> button decides whether this line will be shown or hidden.</li>
			<li>The <span class="hardkey">___ </span> black tick box is for inverting the current line.</li>
			<li>The pull down menu provides all possible masking settings.</li>
			<li>With the <span class="hardkey">Save to</span> button the current mask settings can be stored to the Sheet Mask pool.</li>
			<li>With the <span class="hardkey">Load from</span> button masks can be loaded from the mask pool.</li>
			<li>With the <span class="hardkey">Copy andgt;andgt;andgt;</span> / <span class="hardkey">Copy andlt;andlt;andlt;</span> buttons mask settings can be copied from the fixture to the attribute side and vice versa.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Sheet masks can be stored into the new Sheet mask pool. With this pool, sheet masks can be created once and can be used by multiple sheets.</li>
		<li>The pool objects 1 to 6 are predefined and cannot be modified or deleted.</li>
		<li>Sheet masks are able to mask fixtures and attributes.</li>
		<li>Right mouse click a sheet headline mask button will call this button and edit this button.</li>
		<li>Sheet mask is selectable and editable. The currently selected mask is displayed by a green button background.</li>
		<li>Sheets can be switched to follow selected mask mode.</li>
		<li>Hitting a mask pool object will select this mask and all sheet set to follow selected mask will follow this mask.</li>
		<li>Sheet mask can be assigned to a sheet using ASSIGN, touch a sheet mask in the pool and hit a sheet headline afterwards.</li>
		<li>Up to 10 customizable Set buttons can be assigned to the sheet headlines to provide fast access to sheet masks.</li>
		<li>In addition to the already known masks, the following new criteria for creating masks have been included.</li>
		<li>at the Fixture Section
		<ul>
			<li><strong>"Used in Show"</strong> displays all fixtures stored in cues, selective effects, selective presets or additive group masters.</li>
			<li><strong>"Selected"</strong>displays currently selected fixtures.</li>
			<li><strong>"DMX tested"</strong> displays all fixtures with one or more attributes are overwritten by DMX tester values.</li>
			<li><strong>"Fade/Delay"</strong>displays all fixtures with individual fade or delay timing stored at currently active cues or is active in programmer.</li>
			<li><strong>"Effect"</strong>displays all fixtures currently using effect parameters at the output.</li>
			<li><strong>"In Object"</strong>displays all fixtures currently using the defined object. Object can be a Group, Effect, Preset, Sequence or World.</li>
			<li><strong>"Live"</strong>displays all fixtures with a dimmer output above 0% or with dimmer output at 0% blocked in current active cue.</li>
			<li><strong>"In Saved Selection"</strong>displays the saved selection. The current selection can be saved by the take selection button.</li>
			<li><strong>"Moved"</strong> displays all fixtures with blocked non dimmer values at cues currently active at the output.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>at the Attribute section:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>"Used in Show"</strong> displays all attributes stored in cues, selective effects, selective presets or additive group masters.</li>
			<li><strong>"Selected"</strong> displays all attributes of currently selected fixture.s</li>
			<li><strong>"DMX tested"</strong> displays all attributes overwritten by DMX tester values.</li>

	<li>New sheet headline button to change the sheet readout.</li>
	<li>Filter Pool
	<ul>
		<li>Store filter, At filter, Circular Copy filter and link defined filter have been merged together to one attribute filter and can be stored and recalled by the filter pool. The filter pool is a global pool used by all users.</li>
		<li>Store a filter at the filter pool will store the current status of the filter into the pool object. As at the world pool also at the filter pool filter pool object 1 is reserved for the all filter and is not editable.</li>
		<li>Filters can be called (small green bar in the filter pool icon) or selected (Lower half of the filter pool icon is displayed green).</li>
		<li>The selected filter will be used for any store/at/copy... operation until another filter is selected. Selecting Filter 1 will reset the filter to all attributes.</li>
		<li>Filter can be selected by pressing <span class="hardkey">select</span> and touching the filter pool object afterwards.</li>
		<li>The called filter will override the selected filter and will be used for the next operation and will be falling back to the current selected filter afterwards.</li>
		<li>If the setting "Reset filter on clear " is active in the "Attribute filter menu" a called filter will stay active until 3x clear is pressed (former At filter behavior).</li>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Playback Worlds
	<ul>
		<li>Worlds or filters can be assigned as sequence executor playback filters. The filtered sequence executor will only playback fixtures and attributes of the assigned world or filter.</li>
		<li>If a filter is used as a playback world, the playback will be filtered by attributes only, it will not filter by layer (Value, Value Times, Effects).</li>
		<li>Worlds or filters can be assigned by using command line: <span class="hardkey">Assign</span><span class="hardkey">World</span><span class="hardkey">3</span><span class="hardkey">Executor</span><span class="hardkey">1</span><span class="hardkey">Please</span>, by using the assign menu, or by pressing <span class="hardkey">Assign</span><span class="hardkey">World</span><span class="hardkey"> 3</span> pressing an executor button of an executor with assigned sequence.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Input Filter
	<ul>
		<li>Worlds or filters can be assigned as sequence input filters. The filtered sequence will only store fixtures and attributes of the assigned world or filter.</li>
		<li>Worlds or filter can be assigned by using command line: <span class="hardkey">Assign</span><span class="hardkey">World</span><span class="hardkey">3</span><span class="hardkey">Sequence</span><span class="hardkey">1</span><span class="hardkey">Please</span>, by using the assign menu, or by pressing <span class="hardkey">Assign</span><span class="hardkey">World</span><span class="hardkey"> 3</span> pressing a pool sequence button.</li>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="warning">The command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and the select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers for fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">Selecting multiple fixtures with a lasso in the layout view is respecting the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">Release version <strong>2.3</strong> of grandMA2 divorced values and effect values! Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>show file Conversion from Version 2.2 and earlier:The speed of a selective effect, stored in a cue, will not be brought correct into programmer, if the cue gets edited and the default speed of the effect in the pool is not 60 BMP.</li>
	<li>ASCII show import supports Strand ASCII show files only.</li>
</ul>
