<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New functions and features in detail:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>XYZ</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Stage View XYZ Follow Mode has been added. Activating the follow mode will temporarily deactivate all other stage view modes (Select, Orbit, Panning and Zoom) until the follow mode is disabled. Touching the stage view with activated follow mode will move the beams of the currently selected fixtures with enabled XYZ to this position if possible.</li>
		<li>Virtual XYZ Attributes can be added to any fixture using physical pan/tilt attributes by pressing the new "+XYZ" button at the fixture type editor. Pressing the "-XYZ" button at the fixture type editor will remove the virtual XYZ attributes of the edited fixture type. This will also remove any XYZ values stored for fixtures using this fixture type from your show. XYZ Encoder Resolution Normal = 0.1m, fine=0.01m, ultra=0.001m. The following virtual attributes are added, when adding XYZ support to a fixture.
		<ul>
			<li>PosMod: Mode Attribute to switch between Pan/Tilt and XYZ Mode.</li>
			<li>X, Y and Z: 3 Attributes to define the illuminated position on stage.</li>
			<li>Flip: Attribute to define which flip position of a moving head fixture should be used to reach a certain XYZ position. Special flip modes are:
			<ul>
				<li>AutoFlip: fixture flip is avoided as far as possible.</li>
				<li>NoTiltFlip: fixture tilt axis will never be flipped. This is needed to avoid upside down projections of Gobos or Shaper modules.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mark: Reference Markers attribute is for future use.</li>
			<li>Distance: This attribute is needed for seamless transitions between Pan/Tilt and XYZ. The distance attribute value is the distance between a fixture and the illuminated position/object.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Stage view displays positions of 3D objects with activated "Follow Target" option at the stage view. When creating a new show or loading a show file from a previous version, follow target is activated for the stage plane only.</li>
		<li>New MATricks wing-style modes "X", "Y", "Z" and "X+Y" in addition to the already existing Pan and Tilt wing-style modes.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="important">Do not unblock sequences containing a mixture of XYZ and Pan/Tilt position data nor store /remove or remove values to remove single attributes of the position preset type of cues when using virtual XYZ. This could result in unexpected loss of position data inside your sequence!</div>
	</li>
	<li>Stage fixture position calibration implemented.
	<ul>
		<li>The button to open the Stage fixture position calibration dialog can be found at the stage view options menu. Press the yellow ball to open this menu.</li>
		<li>To be able to calibrate, please mark and measure the corner points (A,B,C,D) of a rectangle at the stage.</li>
		<li>There are two modes of entering the positions of the points A,B,C and D at the calibration dialog.
		<ul>
			<li>Absolute Mode: Please Select fixture(s) and enter the coordinates of point A (X,Y,Z) and the correct distances to the points B and D.</li>
			<li>Free Mode: Select fixtures and enter the correct coordinates of point A (X,Y,Z), B (X,Y,Z), C (X,Y,Z).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Focus each fixture to position A using pan and tilt attributes.</li>
		<li>Select all fixtures again and press the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> button followed by the soft button <span class="hardkey">A</span>. The position of the current selection will be stored for point A.</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for points B, C and D.</li>
		<li>Select all fixtures again and press the soft button <span class="hardkey">Calibrate</span>. The physical positions of all selected fixtures are calibrated now.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="tip">It is possible that each individual fixture can be calibrated within a separate physical rectangle. A'(*)' means that the parameters of the rectangles are not equal across current selection.</div>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>CITP/MSEX 1.0 </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>CITP/MSEX is a network communication protocol designed for communication between lighting consoles and Media servers or visualizers. This first implementation includes thumbnail exchange between third party media servers and grandMA2 consoles.</li>
		<li>The CITP configuration can be found at /Setup/Network/CITP Network Configuration.</li>
		<li>The CITP Enabled button in the upper right corner of this dialog is a global switch to enable/disable CITP session wide.</li>
		<li>There are 4 tabs inside this dialog, Lighting consoles, Media Servers, Visualizers and Operation Hubs.
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Lighting consoles tab:</strong> When pressing add present button at the lighting console tab, any lighting console with enabled CITP will be listed here (for information purposes only).</li>
			<li><strong>Media Servers tab:</strong> At the Media Server Tab, Media Server can be manually added using the add button, or automatically when using the add present button.
			<ul>
				<li>If the row of a media server is red, the media server is not present at the current network, or the CITP functionality of the media server has been switched off.</li>
				<li>If a row of a media server is displayed green, media server is present at the current network.</li>
				<li>At fixture layer column, grandMA2 fixture layer containing media server fixtures has to be chosen.</li>
				<li>If the library and the image subattribute of the media server is not automatically recognized correctly, the user can change them manually by editing the referring grid cell. After pressing the button update thumbnails, the thumbnails of the video or image content will be copied from the media server to wheels inside the fixturetype of the first fixture of the chosen fixture layer. Attribute mode dependencies and channelsets of the chosen library and image attribute of the fixturetype of the first fixture of the chosen layer will be updated. Depending on the number of received thumbnails and the speed of your network, this may take some time. A progress bar at the CITP command cell of the respective media server row is displayed until the transmission is finished.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Visualizers tab: for future use.</li>
			<li>Operation hubs: for future use.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Timecode improvements</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>New clock view modes: SMPTE Timecode and Midi Time Code. Incoming Timecode signals may be displayed using these new clock modes. Receiving valid Timecode signal is displayed by green text color while the text color is grey as long as no valid Timecode signal is received.</li>
		<li>The Timecode Editor Cursor position is not allowed to be negative anymore.</li>
		<li>The current time marker stays in center of timeline while playback or record at the Timecode Editor and Timecode Viewer.</li>
		<li>The number of selected events is shown in the label of encoder 4 "Turn to move n events" at the Timecode editor encoder bar. The new button "clear selection" deselects all currently selected Timecode events.</li>
		<li>Timecode show: There is one time cursor per Timecode show in a network session. The selection of Timecode events and the focus of Timecode tracks is per user profile in a network session.</li>
		<li>Encoder 3 of Timecode bar is now also available in the Timecode view. Events will only be focused and not selected because Timecode view is read only.</li>
		<li>As long as follow time is active in the time code editor or viewer, in graphic mode, the last triggered event of the currently selected track/subtrack is automatically selected/focused during playback. In Text mode, the last triggered event of all currently visible tracks/subtracks is automatically selected/focused during playback. If Timecode sync is set to intern, the Timecode show playback is paused as soon as an event is moved using encoder 4.</li>
		<li>"Copy and paste has been implemented in the Timecode editor. If no event is selected, but a subtrack is focused, all events of that focused subtrack will be copied. In this case the time offset before the first event will be used while pasting at the destination. If events of one subtrack are selected, these events will be copied to the clipboard. The focus has to be set to the target subtrack and the time position the first selected event should be pasted before pressing the paste button. If events of more than one subtrack are selected, all selected events will be copied to the clipboard. The focus has to be set to the first target subtrack and the time position the first selected event should be pasted before pressing the paste button. Pasting multiple subtracks is possible, if the type of the target subtracks matches the source subtracks. "</li>
		<li>The Timecode pool has a "link encoder" option. As long as this option is activated the Timecode encoder bar will be present as soon the Timecode pool is touched.</li>
		<li>A right mouse click on the title of a command track in the Timecode editor opens the "change executor" window.</li>
		<li>A right mouse click on the title of a subtrack in the Timecode editor opens a popup to change the subtrack function.</li>
		<li>Timecode Editor: "Add Here" adds event at next frame, if there is already a event at the current position of the current subtrack. If there is also a event at next frame, no event will be added</li>
		<li>Selecting a Timecode event will show the current trigger time of the selected event above the event. Touching and moving this flag will move the event. When selecting more than one event, the flag will be at the last selected event.</li>
		<li>Timecode editor calculator is using the current Timecode show time unit. The time unit of a Timecode show can be adjusted at the Timecode editor options menu.</li>
		<li>Timecode editor calculator maximum time has been increased to 255h59m59s29F</li>
		<li>Add multiple events wizard at the Timecode editor. The number of added events can be adjusted at the first input box. The second and the third input box are related to each other when changing one of them the other will automatically be recalculated. At the forth input box, the cue of the first event can be selected. Hitting please will create the events. If the number of cues is less than the number of events to add, the wizard will continue adding event starting from the first cue of the sequence.</li>
		<li>There are 4 symbols in front of all Timecode tracks at the Timecode editor: a plus/minus to expand or collapse the subtracks of each track, a checkbox for toggling the visibility of each track in text view, a play symbol (arrow) to enable/disable the playback of each track and a record symbol (red dot) to enable/disable the record functionality of each track.</li>
		<li>Timecode tracks and subtracks can be locked and unlocked using the referring button at the track functions popup. A padlock will be displayed, if a object is locked.</li>
		<li>The Timecode editor text view grid can be sorted by any column. Touching and swipe upwards or downwards at the headline of a column sorts the grid by this column. The sorting order is displayed by a small arrow inside the headline of the column.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Two more trigger types have been added as cue triggers, SMPTE and MTC. The Timecode position has to be entered at the trig time column of the sequence executor sheet. As any other cue trigger, the SMPTE and MTC trigger will only trigger the referring cue if the sequence playback is on and the cue previous to the Timecode triggered cue is active.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Fader Wing setup </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The mapping of the logical 15 fader wide blocks of executors to the physical internal fader modules and external fader wings can be setup at this menu.</li>
		<li>The Fader Wing setup can be found at the /setup/console/Faderwing and Monitor Setup</li>
		<li>The button Add Wing setting adds a new configuration set.</li>
		<li>The button Delete Wing setting deletes the current focused setting.</li>
		<li>The button select Wing setting activates the currently focused setting. The currently used setting is displayed at the menu headline and by an green cell background color.</li>
		<li>The Page+/Page- buttons of the external fader wings can be disabled at this dialog too.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="important">Monitor configuration setup is not supported yet</div>

	<div class="important">The Mini executor displays of screen 3 and 4 are not following the remapped executors, when remapping the internal fader modules.</div>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>New DMX Sheet headline buttons: "Programmer Colors" displays the DMX values in the same colors as the fixture sheet does. At the "Show additional" button the following options can be chosen: "Show only values" shows only the DMX values; "Show IDs" shows the Channel/Fixture ID, name and the DMX value; "Show Attributes" shows the Attribute controlled by this DMX Channel, and "Show Address" shows all single DMX Addresses above the DMX Value.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

An alternating Learn and Macro button backlight will indicate an active Macro recording. Hitting "Record Macro Please" again will switch off the recording mode. Live Recording of Macros will always generate timed macros.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Graphical User Interface </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Mouse cursor and touch cursors have been separated; there is one permanently visible mouse cursor(white arrow) representing the hardware mouse. Each internal touch screen has its own touch cursor and will not set the mouse cursor of the hardware mouse anymore. External touch screens will share the mouse cursor with the hardware mouse. The mouse cursor can be set to an internal touch screen position by holding down the nipple button while touching the screen. The mouse cursor will always follow the touch cursor, if this option is activated at the Setup/Console/Screen Options.

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="warning">The command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and the select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers for fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">Selecting multiple fixtures with a lasso in the layout view is respecting the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">
<ul>
	<li>Release version <strong>2.3</strong> of grandMA2 divorced values and effect values! Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!</li>
	<li>With Version 2.5.70 the default speed of effects and the rate of effect lines has been exchanged by a single speed per line. Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Please check your show file with the new version before using it live!!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>show file Conversion from Version 2.2 and earlier: The speed of a selective effect, stored in a cue, will not be brought correct into programmer, if the cue gets edited and the default speed of the effect in the pool is not 60 BMP.</li>
	<li>ASCII show import supports Strand ASCII show files only.</li>
	<li>MA onPC command wing DMX input is supported for the ports "DMX In" and "DMX out A" only. The port "DMX out B" is allowed to be used as DMX out only!</li>
</ul>
