		<h1>Release Notes - Version 1.X</h1>
		
		<p>* Means something was changed/fixed.</p>

<p>+ Means something was added.</p>

<p>- Means something was removed.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Version 1.9.0 - released 2010-05-25</h2>

<p>+ "Force login" implemented. (Setup/console/global settings).</p>

<p>Note 1: When Force login=off and you start a new show, you are logged in per default as administrator (no longer as guest) When Force login=on, you are logged in per default as guest. You can change the user (tools/login) with your user name and password.</p>

<p>Note 2: When you start a show in a network the login popup does not work .</p>

<p>+ User rights implemented.</p>

<p>Note: The user "guest" has only the permission to "playback". All shows where the user formerly had the profile "guest", are now converted to the profile "administrator". It is possible that macros which were created by the user "guest", will not work correctly. In this version the user right "preset" and "none" is not yet available.</p>

<p>+ Sequence Executor sheet: A and B columns are canceled. Now you have a column mode. This allows "assert" as normal (it takes the cue times from the cue, where the assert values are stored), "x-assert" (applies the current cue timings to the "assert" values) "break" treats values as "cue only" values. It interrupts a tracking list. "x-break" (the same timing behavior as "x-assert").</p>

<p>Note 1: The "break" includes the assert functionality.</p>

<p>Note 2: Values which are stored afterwards in a prior cue, will be released in the as "break" marked cue.</p>

<p>Note 3: Known limitation in this version: Update Original Content ignores Breaks when locating the original value(s). If these updated values then track into a "Break" cue, they will be treated as described above and will NOT track into the current cue(s) being updated.</p>

<p>Note 4: Any tracking sheet edit ignores break as well.</p>

<p>+ copy cue with status / cue only implemented.</p>

<p>Note: "copy cue" will copy all part-cues + engine for cue transition profiles (path) fully implemented Note: Path works for all parameters in a cue/part-cue (In grandMA series 1 this does only work as dimPath and movePath).</p>

<p>+ New Playback "Action Buttons" View.</p>

<p>Note 1: when the option "direct action" in the headline of this view is active, the whole executor touch button has the function from the hardkey.</p>

<p>Note 2: The Playback button view has multitouch functionality.</p>

<p>+ Chaser Speed Mode implemented (setup/user/settings).</p>

<p>+ A/B cross-fade implemented. "Split X-fade" is set to default.</p>

<p>Note: The settings "Split X-fade" and "AB X-fade" have also impact on the normal X-fader.</p>

<p>+ Effects do have now speedgroups.</p>

<p>+ Speedgroups can be assigned on the 100mm Fader.</p>

<p>+ DMX list implemented (setup/show/patch only).</p>

<p>Note 1: In the list of universes you can merge DMX-in and additionally assign which universe will be calculated by the existing parameter count.</p>

<p>Note 2: On the right side you see the DMX patch per channel and can assign profiles directly to the DMX channels. (only coarse) (In the DMX list of grandMA series 1 you can assign profiles only to parameters).</p>

<p>Attention: When you assign a profile to a parameter and at the same time to the same DMX channel, it might neutralize the setting for both assignments.</p>

<p>Note 3: A right click in the headline sorts by columns.</p>

<p>+ Align Function in spezial color dialog in HSB and Fader view implemented.</p>

<p>Note: In HSB view, the brightness will be displayed with varying crosses. Fixtures with different colours have own markers.</p>

<p>+ Add new Fixtures in the setup does now show more patch lines in the fixture wizzard, when the fixtures have more than 1 break (dmx start adresses).</p>

<p>+ High speed MA-net possible Note: when the desk is switched on, the network card determines the current status (100MB / 1GB).In a session is started, the network speed is determined by the slowest participant. You can see this in the commandline view with the command "ni" (networkinfo).</p>

<p>+ In the headline from the edit setup the number of available / used parameters is displayed.</p>

<p>+ executor buttons are now assignable as temp buttons Note: active OffOnOverwritten will NOT be ignored ( as in series1 ).</p>

<p>+ Commandline history implemented. Use the up / down buttons from the keyboard, when the focus is in the commandline in screen 1 or 2.</p>

<p>+ Confirmation box to save old showfile before loading new one.</p>

<p>+ Automatic save show (when switching off the desk) only when the showfile is changed. (the call of views, or a change of pages only, does not force a save show file).</p>

<p>+ MA NPU (Network Processing Unit) does now display the used memory in the main screen.</p>

<p>+ Patch collision dialog implemented.</p>

<p>+ Fixture and Channel Id collision dialog implemented.</p>

<p>+ Multipatch in the patch dialog implemented.</p>

<p>+ Added acceleration of selection via PLEASE key in patch dialog.</p>

<p>+ Telnet access requires login for safety ( Uses user login data).</p>

<p>+ Telnet supports request from command line.</p>

<p>+ Delete cue only implemented.</p>

<p>+ Deleting cue parts methods implemented.</p>

<p>Note: with deleting parts you can also move the values to the default part.</p>

<p>+ Startup macro line implemented (Setup/show/playback+MiB timings).</p>

<p>Note: This commands are executed when the show is loading.</p>

<p>+ Store Option "dmx in" implemented.</p>

<p>+ Sequence Executor sheets interact with commandline.</p>

<p>Note 1: you can use the hardkeys store / label / del directly with a cueline.</p>

<p>Note 2: This interaction works only with the sequence executor sheet, not with the edit sequence sheet.</p>

<p>+ ASCII show read: reading and converting now grandMA series 1 exported files.</p>

<p>+ Backup/load show: select shows or backups or both.</p>

<p>Note: "saveshow" creates one backup for every show with the ending .backup.</p>

<p>Additional: System wide can exist up to 10 backup files with the ending .x.backup (where x is a number from 1..10).</p>

<p>+ Effects can now be switched off in the off-menu.</p>

<p>+ Touchscreens can now be disabled (setup/console/screen options).</p>

<p>+ A new software installer examines the storage capacity of the console / MA NPU and allows to delete old software versions.</p>

<p>Note: it is not allowed to delete the last software version, because we need the last console settings (IP address..)</p>

<p>+ The Layer from a VPU can now be selected from the Desk (setup/network/ma network configuration/video)</p>

<p>Note: This operation is not possible via commandline.</p>

<p>+ The user from a 3d can now be switched from the desk. (setup/network/ma network configuration/visualizer).</p>

<p>+ Special Presets are now marked in the preset pools.</p>

<p>Note 1: With the command "assign preset x.y /special=z" you can build a special preset Variable "z": 0=normal, 1=default, 2=highlight, 3=stage (3 is not implemented yet).</p>

<p>Note 2: These presets will change the fixture/channel default/highligt values directly in the setup!!!</p>

<p>Note 3: You will find new predefined Macros to create special Presets.</p>

<p>+ Edit the MiB field in sequence executor sheet opens now a "select MiB" menu.</p>

<p>Note 1: Known limitation: "late" works only in cues with a full cue number (with cues like 1.1, or 2.3 it will not work).</p>

<p>Note 2: Known limitation: does not work for nontracking sequences.</p>

<p>+ Oops History List implemented (long press on Oops button).</p>

<p>Note 1: it is allowed to select a row in the popup window and oops more operations at one time.</p>

<p>Note 2: Leaving the "patch &amp; fixture schedule" by save, clears the oops list.</p>

<p>+ "Trackball Mode" can be set in user defaults (setup/user/settings).</p>

<p>+ Diagnostic View implemented (Setup/Patch&amp;Fixture Schedule) It shows a report of warnings/errors from the current range, you are.</p>

<p>Note: When you will leave the edit setup you see a selection menu, when they are warnings.</p>

<p>+ "Manual x-fade" for presets and executor buttons implemented (encoder bar).</p>

<p>Note 1: When enabling the function "set time" or "manual x-fade" for presets the number of attributes from the selected fixtures are displayed. When enabling the function "manual x-fade" for executor buttons, the number of different buttons, pushed prior to the manual fade will be displayed The LEDs of the corresponding executor buttons blink.</p>

<p>Note 2: This timings are not working with the colorpicker at this time.</p>

<p>Note 3: The preset times does work for all programmer actions except effects.</p>

<p>+ Predefined Profiles are implemented. (setup/patch+fixture schedulle/DMX profiles/edit profile).</p>

<p>+ Timecode editor: New Buttons "add track", "change executor" and "add subtracks" (in track functions).</p>

<p>Note: The "Delete Track"-Button now also deletes "Sub Tracks" If a command sub track is selected [first subtrack], the whole track will be deleted. Otherwise only the selected subtrack will be deleted.</p>

<p>+ Timecode editor - text view: added lasso selection im timecode grid.</p>

<p>+ "DMX at" implemented ( similar to grandMA series1 ).</p>

<p>+ Fixture library updated. (from carallon lib 6.2) + Color library updated.</p>

<p>Note: The color library is only reimported in a new, empty show To use in old showfiles: commandline: cd 9, delete *, import swatchbook, cd/.</p>

<p>+ Fixturesheets are now able to display 16 attributes of one feature (previous versions 8).</p>

<p>+ Option menu in preset pools has now a "reset color" button. (also in setup/user/window settings/presets/...).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* deleting a fixture layer and then saving the showfile does no longer destroy the showfile.</p>

<p>* Progress bars show better status of showupload / download and save showfile.</p>

<p>* The "auto shutdown" popup must be confirmed on the touchscreen and cannot be confirmed accidentally with the "please" button of the keyboard anymore (there is no focus automaticly in the popup).</p>

<p>* Close the Expand Virtual Keyboard in Backup / new Show, will no more created directly a new show.</p>

<p>* In the "cue renumbering popup" the numeric keypad does work also.</p>

<p>* "ifoutput" in combination with bitmap effects crashes the desk no more.</p>

<p>* Loop funktion now also works for cues with timed trigger.</p>

<p>* Content sheets with Part cues cannot crash the desk anymore.</p>

<p>* The fixture sheet in "vertical mode" updates fixture names, when changing these names in live access.</p>

<p>* The learn button on speedgroups and effects works again.</p>

<p>* Edit profiles: Graph editor limits movement of points to the current value range. ...means you can no longer drag points of a dmx profile outside the display area.</p>

<p>* "Knightrider effect" is taken out (locked state of console).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known bugs and limitations:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Remote configuration of MA 2Port Nodes via grandMA2 is shown right in the display of the nodes, but do not change the real output online. After resetting the nodes (disconnect/connect mains) everything is working fine.</p>

<p>- Fixture Types with more than 2 Mode channels may not work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Version 1.8.0 - released 2010-04-12</h2>

<p>+ Move in Black (MIB) with the possibility to enter the MIB-executing cue in the MIB column Additional Options: "Early" / "Late" / "-x" (cues) (while MIB is running, the LEDs off the Executor Button flash: fast = MIB delaytime, slow = MIB fadetime).</p>

<p>Note: First MIB now works without storing a zero dimmer-value before. (this was necessary in grandMA series 1).</p>

<p>+ "temp fader" and "temp master fader" (for selected sequence) implemented also in combination with "restart first cue" and "restart next cue".</p>

<p>Note: "temp fader" fades also swap attributes. "x-fader" switch the swap attributes.</p>

<p>+ New Fixture editor - Divided into "module manager", "wheel manager" and "instance manager".</p>

<p>+ Attribute &amp; encoder grouping with new subattributes The column "encoder grouping" includes names.</p>

<p>+ New Keyword: "shuffleselection" (You will find it in the predefined Macros also).</p>

<p>+ New Keyword: "clearactive" (clear II). (You will find it in the predefined Macros also).</p>

<p>+ New Keyword: "cmdhelp". ( a overview of all Keywords).</p>

<p>+ New Keywords: "Layer Value", "Layer Fade", "Layer Delay", "Layer EffectForm", "Layer EffectRate", "Layer EffectValue1", "Layer EffectValue2", "Layer EffectPhase", "Layer EffectWidth".</p>

<p>+ Playback and MIB defaults in Setup / Show. New &gt;&gt;&gt; + &lt;&lt;&lt; timings (The default timings are stored in the showfile).</p>

<p>+ An effect can now be "absolute", "relative" or "transparent". This is shown in a new column in the edit effect view, and in the effect pool in the headlines of the effects as A, R, T .</p>

<p>Let's assume we have 2 different executors: exec 1 has some beams on stage positions and exec 2 has a circle effect (cuelist style, not directly assigned effect). How normal modes (absolute or relative) behave:</p>

<p>a) Starting exec 1 first and then overwriting it with exec 2 would by default make the beams circle around their center positions and not around the stage position from exec 1, because that is overwritten.</p>

<p>b) Starting exec 2 first and then overwriting it with exec 1 would by default stop the circle and the beams would go to a steady stage position because the effect is overwritten.</p>

<p>How transparent mode behaves:</p>

<p>a) looks different, because the circle effects will be laid 'transparently’ over the exec 1 stage positions.</p>

<p>If you assign a high priority to exec 2, then also b) looks different, because it will always overlay other normal or low priority executors in this transparent way.</p>

<p>As an easy reminder : Transparency defines whether effects and values are combined between different playbacks.</p>

<p>+ Effect pools now also show the number of the current fixtures using this effect, even they are out of cues. We can switch of any of these fixtures, when making a fixture selection and "off" this effect. When there is no fixture selection, an "off effect x" switches off the whole effect.</p>

<p>+ New effect button in presetbar</p>

<p>+ Press and hold the wheel button opens a popup for the encoder, the wheel resolution and clear screens</p>

<p>+ New patch dialog in setup</p>

<p>+ Fixture, channel and tracking sheet: Preset values can now be shown by their name or by their number (selectable in the option menu)</p>

<p>+ The commands "on", "off", "park" and "unpark" now work in combination with the feature field in the attribute encoder bar.</p>

<p>+ DMX-in merge: The grandMA2 now merges 2 DMX-in Universe HTP to 1 DMX-out. The DMX-in can be plugged-in on different consoles or MA NPUs in the network. (known limitation: this currently does not work with MA 2Port Nodes) When plugging in more the 2 universes, only the first 2 will be used, all others will be ignored.</p>

<p>+ New preset style: Global "selective" stores values for single fixtures "global" stores values for fixture types "universal" stores values for all fixture types which own the currently stored attributes.</p>

<p>Note1: "universal" works only for the attributes Dimmer, Pan Tilt, RGB, CMY, ( Stage positions xyz will be implemented later ).</p>

<p>Note2: the function "universal" from grandMA series 1 had to be changed to "global", due to have "universal" equal in presets and effects.</p>

<p>+ Loops call up the tracking status of a cue now (same as goto x).</p>

<p>+ Assign menu: The option buttons are rearranged. MIB never is added.</p>

<p>+ New functions in "special dialog" of swatch book: "clear filter" + "live preview".</p>

<p>+ Midi Remotes: velocity works on Executor Fader.</p>

<p>Note1: if "auto start = on" and "auto stop = on" then velocity brings up the fader to 100% (velocity = 127). When velocity is going to "0", the fader remains untouched and the executor is switched off. If "auto start = on" and "auto stop = off" then velocity brings the fader up and down and the executor stays on.</p>

<p>Note2: you can see the incoming midi notes and their velocity in the "system monitor"</p>

<p>+ "Fast off" for "auto stop" implemented.</p>

<p>Note: "executor off times" are ignored when pulling the master fader to 0 ("auto stop = on") When the master fader is &gt;0: the first "off" takes the "off times", the second "off" switches the executor directly off. Switching off over the "off menu" will follow the "off times".</p>

<p>+ Import / Export effects implementiert Note: to export via commandline: "sd 3" (selectdrive) followed by "Export effect x thru y "nameofFolder" To import: command "sd 3" (selectdrive) followed by "cd effect" (change to effect folder on the harddisk) and then "import *".</p>

<p>+ New firmware update 1.28 (adjusts the brightness of the new LEDs in new consoles).</p>

<p>+ grandMA2 onPC will automatically and temporarily add an artnet IP-address to adapter ( if not already defined ).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* Faderwings now store their position in the console.</p>

<p>* "Load cue" now loads the status of a tracking cue when the cue is started with an "x fader" or a "tempfader".</p>

<p>* Delete cues or merge new cues does not confuse the timecode-links anymore.</p>

<p>* Command entry via the nummerical block &gt;Channel x full&lt;, &gt;time time 0 thru 5&lt; does work correct now.</p>

<p>* "at filter view" now supports internal mouse control.</p>

<p>* The backup menu now can show the filenames as symbols or list, or details.</p>

<p>* Label an existing View on a Viewbutton does now show the existing name.</p>

<p>* Open a Calculator of an attribute with more than 28 channel sets -&gt; now there is a scroll bar.</p>

<p>* Edit Chaser brings up the chaser playback bar directly to the encoder.</p>

<p>* Loading a show containing MA NPUs -&gt; active sequences have output.</p>

<p>* External timecodeview cannot crash the desk anymore when the view is in text mode.</p>

<p>* Deleting an effect when the effect edit view is open will not crash the desk anymore.</p>

<p>* Flashing fixtures which are running a chaser effect do have the right timing now.</p>

<p>* In a macro line the "+, - and thru" do now work from numeric keypad.</p>

<p>* Remove a fixture from the current world now refreshes the Fixture sheet.</p>

<p>* Fixture x at fixture y now copies also effects which have been started from a cuelist.</p>

<p>* A effect assigned directly on an executor can now also be started with go-.</p>

<p>* Fixture sheet: The layer "values only" does no more show the channel sets.</p>

<p>* Predefined macros which are switching the remotes on / off had to be reworked because the folder structure was changed.</p>

<p>* Effects where "phase from" and "phase to" have the same value do work now.</p>

<p>* Saving shows with illegal filenames doesn`t crash the network anymore.</p>

<p>* Backwards running effects with low rate do work now correctly.</p>

<p>* Remote DMX-in to programmer works again.</p>

<p>* Multiselection in effect editor enabled (with "ctrl").</p>

<p>* Multiple dummy channels possible when building a new fixtue.</p>

<p>* Update Bug in the Off menu in Freeze Mode fixed.</p>

<p>* Spezial effect dialog shows the right "default width" values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Info:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When using a MA NPU in grandMA1 compatibility mode as MA 4Port Node, you must update the MA NPU with the newest software version also.</p>

<p>All RGB fixtures from the new Library have no more RGB Attributes, they are converted to inverted CMY Fixtures. Whenever you create a new Fixture, and need RGB attributes with a real or a virtual dimmer, please take the CM1, CM2 and CM3 inverted attributes.</p>

<p>The old RGB attributes are now named colordim1 (red), colordim2 (green), colordim3 (blue), colordim4 (amber), colordim5 (white).</p>

<p>* Crash removed when scrolling in content sheets and track sheets</p>

<p>* Crash removed when deleting timecode view</p>

<p>* unpatch fixtures when fixture type is substituted</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Version 1.6.0 - released 2009-12-18</h2>

<p>+ Timecode is implemented. Operating philosophy as in grandMA Series 1 Additional: A new timecode view can be positioned freely on all screens. In timecode pool you now see the status from the timecode. The time is displayed green, if the incoming time is in the current record range Repeat function for Internal TC shows New Commandline Keyword record Userbits can identify an incoming timecode signal</p>

<p>+ Backup Menu: Automated copy of all showfiles of older versions in current folder is now suppressed. Now , there will be an own folder created for each version. That means that older showfiles can be loaded there and then will be stored in the current version folder. The old version showfiles remain untouched.</p>

<p>+ Attributes &amp; Encorder grouping is implemented (Setup / Show / Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule / Fixture Types) Note 1: it is now possible to delete preset types, after moving the attributes into another preset type. The remaining preset types will then be renumbered automatically. When you call a preset type from a macro, use the preset type name, not the id. Note 2: In this version the encorder grouping works only with numbers. When you activate an attribute in the programmer,all attributes with the same number will be activated as well.</p>

<p>+ Restart Options in assign menu First Step, Current Step, Next Step</p>

<p>+ Channel Pages are working in a first way: You can assign your own Fixtures to the channel pages: Switch to Channel Page to create a blank page &gt;assign channel 1 thru&lt; and push the first channelfader - this assigns all dimmer channels ( similar to grandMA series 1 ) &gt;Assign channel x channelfader y&lt; - this assigns this channel to the current channelpage (shortcut for channelfader = cf ) &gt;Assign channel x channelpage y.z&lt; - ( shortcut for channelpage = cp ) Note: The Flash button does not work in the programmer.</p>

<p>+ Setup / User / Settings Message box on all screens.</p>

<p>+ Setup / User / Settings: Wheel Mode The Wheel Mode is also displayed in screen 2</p>

<p>+ New Set Time button for preset time fader and executor Button time fader in screen 2. In addition you can assign an on and off button for this speciale Master to an executor.</p>

<p>+ Solo now works in the selected user-world.</p>

<p>+ Profiles can now be assigned to single attributes in single fixtures ( &gt;Edit Fixture x&lt; )</p>

<p>+ Patch in setup opens a new view with an overview of the current patched DMX channels.</p>

<p>+ Import Export Fixture Types</p>

<p>+ Macros to / from USB</p>

<p>* If Merge if not empty is switched on ( Store Options ), new Presets and Groups can be stored. The command &gt;store 1 thru 6 merge&lt; executed on a current cuelist which only contains cues 1, 3, +5 does not create new cues anymore.</p>

<p>* ATTN: Midi Notes send and receive numbering is now consistent ( means old setups +-1 )</p>

<p>* Setup / Remote inputs / midi remotes: Midi Channel set to 0 means "all" channels from one note</p>

<p>* Specialized shaper dialog: U1-U3 buttons have now functions, same as Softbuttons</p>

<p>* &gt;channel x at channel y&lt; displayes now the correct Values, when the values from channel y comes from an selective preset.</p>

<p>* Split X Fade in non Tracking Sequences is working now correctly</p>

<p>* Tracking Sheet: when editing the predefined sets (1-5) corresponding window will be opened</p>

<p>* Fixture Sheet: Column order does not change anymore by accident</p>

<p>* Agenda: week view improved</p>

<p>* Agenda: Slave desk are now allowed to make entries</p>

<p>* Patch Fixtures with Breaks works now over commandline: &gt;assign Fixture 1 true 10 at DMX 2.1/break=1&lt;</p>

<p>* Running a preset or calling a viewbutton with the focus active in the presetpool does not switch the encoder bar anymore. Only focusing the title of a pool or calling the preset type name from the command line switches the bar now</p>

<p>* Short fadetimes in network ( after a showupload ) are working now in all network protocols</p>

<p>* The command Terminate effects now works in programmer</p>

<p>* If grandMA2 onPC runs with window frames the windows are only moveable by grabbing the title bar. Without window frames the only possibility to move the window is to hit the background.</p>

<p>* Follow cues without times run saver in networks with MA NPUs</p>

<p>* Deleting DMX adresses via commandline from a slavedesk removes also the DMX values on the output</p>

<p>* Sequence sheet: after moving the columns the content can be changed via the Encoder</p>

<p>* Update Cues original content only does work again</p>

<p>* Copy userprofiles does now work correctly in the network</p>

<p>* Store and Remove with Active for Selected does work now</p>

<p>* Chase encoder bar: reverse button has function now</p>

<p>* After a restart the user login stays same</p>

<p>* No encoder playbar when fixtures or channels in selection</p>

<p>//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ASCII import from Strand Genius Plus =========================================== Setup ASCII import of Profiles not implemented. ASCII import of Parameter Limits EXPERIMENTAL - watch out for fixtures such as DLCs which can rely on this feature to prevent the scroller from ripping off the end. Cues The cuelist has been imported as a fully unblocked, tracking sequence. Before editing, you may wish to look at your Strand showfile and re-instate the blocks before you begin to edit your show. Submasters Check that the priority of the executer faders is correct. Also note that Inhibitive Submasters are Negative Group Masters on MA2 and are imported accordingly. Effects It is very likely that you will want to convert the imported effect sequences into chasers (and change the cue triggers to 'Go’), or re-write them as MA2 Effects.If you want to keep the Strand effects as they are imported, you will need to make changes so they actually go off - unfortunately, the Effect Off options are not exported to the ASCII file so you will need to go through your show and make sure all effect sequences have an off trigger. Here are some ideas: Effects Off commands in the Cuelist Look through your Strand Cuelist and where you see the lower case 'f’, change the corresponding MA2 Cmd Link to stop the sequence. Effects Off after Cycles Turn off [Wrap Around] Loop the last cue to the first and add the desired loop count Create a new blank cue at the end, set the Trigger type as desired so it will run when the loop is completed and assign the relevant Cmd Link to stop the sequence. Effects Off after Time Create a blank cue 0.001 at the very beginning of the sequence. Assign the Cmd Delay to the time you need and fill in the Cmd field to instruct the sequence to stop. Use the Loop function on the remaining cues to ensure this cue is never re-triggered after it's first execution. //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Version 1.4.1 - released 2009-09-30</h2>

<p>+ New MA 2Port Node Version 1.36: Performance of the 2Port Node increased when a lot of parameters change their values at the same time.</p>

<p>+ New assign menu options for Sequences</p>

<ul>
	<li>Auto Stop has to be disabled, Master Go is activated, when taking the fader up again the next cue will be started.</li>
	<li>Master On: same as explained above, but when taking the fader up the actual cue will be started again.</li>
	<li>Master Go Off: same as explained above, but the cue is still active, only the dimmer is changed when the fader is taken up, the same cue is active all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>+ Virtual Dimmer functionality is now for CMY implemented.</p>

<p>+ New settings in the fixture sheet: readout "natural" reflects the range settings for the Fixture type itself. This means that you now can define the ranges for controlling fixtures yourself by editing the Fixture in the setup and changing the settings in the fixture sheet to shift also the units of your control encoders.</p>

<p>+ When starting a new show or saving a show identically with an existing show name, then a user prompt will warn the user.</p>

<p>+ The Encoder Selection Button for the screen encoder of screen 1 and 2 is intelligent now and changes its state with a focus change on screen 1 or screen 2.</p>

<p>+ Library of fixture types improved in grandMA2.</p>

<p>+ Multi patch can now be applied via the command line (e.g. Assign Channel 1 at DMX 1.1 thru 1.50 overwrites the actual patch of Channel 1. Assign DMX 1.60 at Channel 1 is adding a multi patch. DMX universes can also be addressed absolute now: e.g. Assign Channel 1 DMX 513 thru 1025.</p>

<p>+ grandMA2 replay unit (RPU) does have a screen saver option now.</p>

<p>+ MA button plus "." (dot) button does copy default values in the programmer for the selected Fixtures.</p>

<p>* Copy Cue X at Cue Y does copy all values now that have been entered in the Sequence Executor Sheet.</p>

<p>* Console settings, local exported macros, locally stored bitmap and fixture files are now copied when a new release is installed.</p>

<p>* Fixture X at Fixture Y does only copy non default values like in grandMA series 1 and uses the At Filter at the same time.</p>

<p>* Preset Time Fader can now be adjusted in seconds.</p>

<p>* If the width of a column in a sheet is adjusted and stored in a view, this adjustment is recalled when opening the view again.</p>

<p>* The option Multi Control is working again in the Fixture- and Channel Sheet.</p>

<p>* If Fixtures or Channels have been released, this is indicated with an (R) displayed in the Channel and Fixture Sheet.</p>

<p>* Text input in macros (e.g. Group("Which Group do you want to select?") allows you to write a question mark in the user prompt text now.</p>

<p>* Off All Buttons, Off All Faders and Everything Off in the Off Menu is applied to all Executor Pages now.</p>

<p>* Activating dimmer values of Channels and Fixtures below 100% does only activate the value now and does not cause a jump to 100% now.</p>

<p>* The Smart View is automatically updated now.</p>

<p>* When controlling Fixtures which do not have the identical parameter (e.g. one with Pan / Tilt and one without) you can now enter values via the calculator again.</p>

<p>* You can select the units used for display above the Attribute Encoders via the Fixture Sheet. If more than one Fixture Sheet is used, then the last selected one controls them.</p>

<p>* Snap Delay Defaults in Setup/User/Defaults/Sequence Defaults/ are working now.</p>

<p>* When a Fixture Sheet is scrolled to do a certain selection, it keeps this state even if the user selects different Worlds now.</p>

<p>* The progress bar of Executors is now also considering Goto and Off commands combined with timings (e.g. Goto Cue 5 Fade 4).</p>

<p>* The At Filter is now working when used in combination with at Cue, At Preset and At Effect.</p>

<p>* Beam Intensities when editing fixture types can now have values above 180 (for 3D visualiser).</p>

<p>* Opening an edit window for an Executor and deleting Cue 1 does not crash the console any more.</p>

<p>* Disconnection of a session master automatically keeps the session alive by choosing another master station in the Session.</p>

<p>* When 2 consoles are connected and the slave console enters the setup and leaves it again, you will see no Art-Net value interruption any more.</p>

<p>* When you disconnect the association of a Channel or Fixture to the Grandmaster then you will see no Art-Net value interuption any more.</p>

<p>* Parked values are kept now when leaving the setup of a master console that is connected to a slave console.</p>

<p>* Relative Effects can now also have negative value ranges.</p>

<p>* It is now possible to copy ranges of Cues (e.g. Copy Cue 2 thru 4 at Cue 9).</p>

<p>* Edit Exec X and a Delete Cue Y does not crash the console any more.</p>

<p>* Edit Cue X does bring the status of the Cue in the Programmer including tracked information and not only the actual stored values in the Cue.</p>

<p>* If Part Cues are stored, a user prompt is only displayed now if the part already existed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Version 1.4.0.2, released 2009-09-11</h2>

<p><strong>General explanation of effects Short introduction into effects of grandMA2:</strong></p>

<p>When you think of the new effects - compare them very much to universal presets as you know them.</p>

<p>Effects contain 2 different kind of data sets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first set contains generic rules.</li>
	<li>The second set contains individual overwrites for the generic rules per channel.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may also want to compare this behaviour to basic/individual timing in cues.</p>

<p>Therefore we will call effect parameters that come from the generic rule BASIC, while we call the other effect parameters INDIVIDUAL.</p>

<p><strong>If you create a new effect by</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>editing an empty effect</li>
	<li>adding one or more effect lines</li>
	<li>assigning attributes to the effect lines</li>
	<li>taking the current selection for the effect lines</li>
	<li>and playing around with the parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>.. you will have a fully basic effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>There are 3 ways to run your new effect</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>calling it like a preset into the programmer</li>
	<li>assigning it directly to an executor</li>
	<li>or storing it into a cue, after you called it like a preset</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you run it, you will see the effect parameters in the fixture sheet in grey, because your new effect only contains basic parameters.</p>

<p>But as soon as you switch your encoders to effect parameters and turn the encoder, you will activate individual overrides in the programmer and the update LED turns on.</p>

<p>Depending on the origin of your effect parameters, the update window will present you the choice to update the effect or alternatively to update the cue.</p>

<p>Updating the effect will store the individual changes into the effect, and all cues that use this effect in a basic way will also show the new effect parameters after the next go.</p>

<p>Updating the cue on the other side, will apply the individual changes to that cue only, and other cues that use the same effect in a basic way are not affected.</p>

<p>After updating, try to run the effect/cue again. The individual effect parameters are now standing out clearly in the fixture sheet, because they are coloured.</p>

<p>If you updated the effect and have a look at it in the effects editor, you might find 2 different things there:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The effect changed its general rule by analysing the individual parameters The effect was also optimized in a way, that the the majority of parameters that complied with the general rule is no more individual</li>
	<li>Effect lines that have individual parameters will be shown with a slightly red background</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Another thing that differs from grandMA series 1 effects: </strong></p>

<p>The output of an effect is calculated differently now. It is a value between VALUE1 and VALUE2 which are parameters of an effect line. The transition between VALUE1 and VALUE2 is controlled by the choosen FORM. It is even possible to use presets as VALUE1 or VALUE2 !!!</p>

<p>~ Programmer can not fade effects</p>

<h2>Version 1.2 - released 2009-07-20</h2>

<p>+ MA 2Port Node is implemented for grandMA2. To update the MA 2Port Node use grandMA or grandMA onPC 6.122 as usual. The update in this version from grandMA2 does not work. There is no other way since the node in version 1.32 or below does not speak "grandMA2" language. In the future this procedure will work if the MA 2Port Node has ever seen Version 1.34.</p>

<p>+ 2Ports are now handled the way as MA NSP's are in grandMA and they have to be manually inserted in the setup. When clicking add you can see a list of all available units. In the future you can update the nodes from the console. "NNU" (network node update) in the command line and the "Software Update" soft button will do the job.</p>

<p>+ "NNI" (network node info) in the command line list the information about all available MA 2Port Nodes in the network.</p>

<p>+ Going out of desk lock the 100mm Main Executor and the Grandmaster recover their last position.</p>

<p>+ Sequence Sheet has 5 Sets of columns.</p>

<p>+ Special Master functionality added to 100mm main executors.</p>

<p>+ Layer Control Bar in Channel- and Fixture Sheet does now reflect fade and delay values when in auto mode.</p>

<p>+ Assert option added in sequence content sheet This option reacts in terms of playback: if a value is tracked and not blocked in first sequence and overwritten by another sequence on an executor, enabling assert for the first sequence will output the tracked value of the first sequence even though the other executor is running.</p>

<p>+ Preset Time Fader for programmer now user independent over the whole network.</p>
