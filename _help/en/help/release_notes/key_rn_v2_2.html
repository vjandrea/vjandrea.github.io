<h3>New functions and features in detail:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>New help functions:Search function added in help view. (Magnifying Glass)Pushing and holding the "help" hardkey while pushing another hardkey, brings up information about this key.Pushing the "help" hardkey, pushing another hardkey and completing with "please", brings up a help about the keyword. (for "edit" or "store", the command must be written in the command line).</li>
	<li>Server backup:The desk automatically creates a folder structure (similar to the one which would be created when using an USB stick) when using the backup option "ftp / windows shared folder", (gma2 / shows... macros...) for the first time.Note: The first show which is saved, after a backup server is configured, creates the folder "gma2/shows"</li>
	<li>Backup menu:Loading only "userprofiles" (without data) from a show file overwrites the existing user and all userprofiles.Note: A normal "load show data" without userprofiles, adds user and userprofiles.</li>
	<li>Backup menu:In the option "delete show(s)" it is now possible to select several lines by using a lasso.</li>
	<li>New button assignment and defaults for special master.New functions "halfspeed" and "doublespeed" for speedfader added.</li>
	<li>New representation in mini executor sheet, when a sequence has only one cue.</li>
	<li>The "mini executor sheets" (above the executor fader) have an indicator in the small fader bar, when a"playback master" is assigned.</li>
	<li>"Setup / show / midi show control" menu has a "msc in monitor" field for incoming msc commands.</li>
	<li>MSC (midi show control) supports now also "flash" and "black" button presses.</li>
	<li>Added hardkey support for keyword "Call": Push 2x "on"</li>
	<li>"call cue x" for a nontracking sequence loads actual content of (selected sequence) Cue x into the programmer and activates these values."call cue x" for a tracking sequence loads tracking values of (selected sequence) Cue x into the programmer(as non-active values) and loads actual content of Cue x into programmer and activates these values Note: "call thru x" loads the status of cue x in the active programmer.</li>
	<li>Speed master has now a status LED.</li>
	<li>The speedmaster status is now stored in showfile.</li>
	<li>Sequence executors have now "halfspeed" and "double speed" buttons Note: They are working synchronized to the rate.</li>
	<li>Better workflow when using "at filter": target - source - filter.e.g. "fixture 2 at fixture 1", then long press of "at", choose filter, "please".</li>
	<li>The DMX tester has a new "unpark" button.</li>
	<li>The command "shutdown" has now the options: "Save", "Don´t save" and "Esc."</li>
	<li>Edit an embedded preset now shows the original preset name/number in the fixture sheet.</li>
	<li>Random function in effects improved.</li>
	<li>Sequence executor sheet: Set a time in the column "trig time" switches the trigger automatically from "go" to"time".</li>
	<li>Bitmap Effects support 32bit BMP -files.</li>
	<li>The command "delete sequence x" deletes only fixtures of the current world in this sequence.If the current world includes all fixtures which are stored in this sequence, the whole sequence will be deleted.(same as before).</li>
	<li>The command "assign time" "please" (without values) assigns the default time(Setup/User/Defaults/Sequence defaults) to the current cue of the selected sequence.</li>
	<li>"program time" and "exec time" assigned to a executor fader, shows the function (with an indicator) in mini executor sheet.</li>
	<li>"Oops" now works for "park", "unpark" and "import"</li>
	<li>Content sheet in "manual" mode has a new focus:Touch in the grid, the scroll-encoder scrolls inside the shown cue.Touch in the titlebar, the scroll-encoder scrolls inside the cue list.</li>
	<li>The 100mm faders have a new option "empty".</li>
	<li>Typing the command "label" before doing a lasso selection in the channel sheet allows to label all selected channel names in one go.</li>
	<li>MSC - Cue commands having less than three digits had been ignored - no longer!</li>
	<li>Tracking sheet: The width of the "number" + "name" columns is now stored in views.</li>
	<li>Setup:The "user" tap redraws, when changing the user via the command line.</li>
	<li>Assign menu:The "empty" field works now.</li>
	<li>DMX-Tester selection is now cleared on show-load, new-show, and show-download.</li>
	<li>CMDHELP filter operates again. E.g. "cmdhelp c*" shows all commands starting with "c".</li>
	<li>"CMD link" in cues works now when executor started with a "flash" or "temp" button, too.</li>
	<li>In the tracking sheet the height of rows adapt to the font size.</li>
	<li>Desk light status is now loaded from show file. (setup / console / local settings)</li>
	<li>Follow Cues, timed cues, or chaser overwrite now also contained values in the programmer, when "freeze" is off.Note: Before only the first cue did overwrite programmer values</li>
	<li>"edit preset x.y" / "update", destroyed the preset filter and the embedded mode - no longer.</li>
	<li>Export of large Cue lists doesn´t crash the desk anymore.</li>
	<li>The "special master"s 1 thru 8 are displayed in green.Note: They apply only to the "selected sequence".</li>
	<li>A sequence on an executor fader can now be started with a X-fader, even the x-fader is up (on 100).</li>
	<li>Delete a running sequence / chaser with a opened edit view will not crash the desk anymore.</li>
	<li>When deleting show files from a USB drive, the drive is synchronized immediately.</li>
	<li>"edit executor x", the focus of the edit popup view is now in the actual cue, and can be changed directly with the encoder.</li>
	<li>The command "assign view 1 thru 5 viewbutton 11.1 thru" works correctly.</li>
	<li>Delete the selected sequence and store a new cue on the same executor, the selection is no longer lost.</li>
	<li>You can’t delete channel faders which are not in your world no more.</li>
	<li>An executor "temp or flash button" does not switch off another executor, when "off on overwritten" is switched on.e.g.: Now you can assign the same sequence on the executor 1 (cues with colors) and executor 111 with a flash button.</li>
	<li>The desk has now only one single ftp access: User=data, password=data.No access to the /root anymore (user "root" will be no longer supported)</li>
	<li>"Copy cue only" works when the target cue does not exist.</li>
	<li>The magenta color frame is displayed correctly now, when a jumping by "go-" into a looped cue.</li>
	<li>Pushing the "flash" button on a channel fader shows the output value now in the mini executor window(above the fader)</li>
	<li>The "load" and "goto" popups can be operated with the numeric keys.</li>
	<li>The replay unit (RPU) displays the preset types in the encoder tool bar now.</li>
	<li>Fixtures with virtual dimmer display the correct values in the Stage View (and 3D), when working in edit blind programmer</li>
	<li>Park / unpark and a lasso in the channel sheet is working again.</li>
	<li>The keyword "color" is switched to "gel". (press the hardkey "preset" 3x) - b.t.w the respective functionality does not exist by now</li>
	<li>The command "assign selection channelfader 1" is working now.</li>
	<li>The command "store cue 1 /m" and push an executor hardkey, works now.</li>
	<li>Moving a fixed executor moves now also the fix status.</li>
	<li>A virtual channel has now the "virtual DMX range" 0-255 (before 0-1).All channel functions and channel settings can be created/edited related to that range.(MIB works now for fixtures with virtual dimmer.)</li>
	<li>Import keyword using in the command line:if "bla-xml" contains two macros the command import "bla" at macro 10 will import these two macros to macro 10 and macro 11. If macro 11 already exists the user will be asked whether to overwrite it. (To prevent overwrite by mistake.)import "bla" at macro 15+20 will import the macros to 15 and 20."import" shows some info in the commandline Parameter "/noconfirm" skips overwrite warning. Parameter "/quiet" disables the extra info in the command line</li>
	<li>New Features, attributes and subattributes will be inserted at a better position (before they were always added at the end).E.g. if "gobo1" and "gobo3" exists, "gobo2" will be created in-between.Or if the attribute "movingpath-&gt;translation-y" exists, "translation-x" will be inserted before; "translation-z"will be added after. This belongs to manual creation of these objects and to the import of fixture types, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known bugs and limitations:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Remote configuration of 2Port Nodes via grandMA2 is shown right in the display of the nodes, but do not change the real output online. After resetting the nodes (disconnect/connect mains) everything is working fine.</li>
	<li>Fixture Types with more than 2 Mode channels may not work</li>
</ul>
