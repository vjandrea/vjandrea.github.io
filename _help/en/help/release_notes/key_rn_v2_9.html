		<h2>Release Notes - Version 2.9</h2>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>The MA-Net2 protocol has changed to support the 8Port Node devices. All MA devices need a new network streaming protocol with the 2.9 software. Once updated to the correlating Version to grandMA2 v2.9, 2Port, 4Port, 8Port, NSP 4Port Node and the NDP will no longer work in a session with an older network streaming protocol (e.g.: grandMA2 v2.8). Down-dating MA 2Port Nodes and NSP running in 4Port Node Mode to be v2.8 compatible is possible only via grandMA1 v 6.801. All other devices can be down-dated via USB or windows installer only.</li>
	<li>If you would like to update your dimMA system from any version below 7.x please contact your MA-dealer or MA direct for any update information. Should you be using grandMA2 in connection to our dimMA solutions, please get in touch with us, since a console update will now require a NDP update and vice versa. We are happy to assist you.</li>
	<li>The current versions of grandMA onPC and MA 3D require minimum Windows® XP with Service Pack 3. Microsoft® .NET Framework (4.0) will be installed on your computer, if not already installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New functions and features in detail:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Color Mixing System</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Color special dialog has new operating elements which define which color attributes are used to mix the color. In addition to colorRGBs, color wheels(C1...) and scroller are supported.</li>
		<li>RGB (Headline in fixture sheet) was renamed in Mix color and contains all additive colors.</li>
		<li>There is a "RAW Faders" view. All color channels of the current selected fixtures are displayed e.g. R G B A W.</li>
		<li>The"HSB" view has a "Q" Fader. Only active when fixtures are selected which have also other additive color channels than RGB. Set to 0% / Pure, the color is mixed mainly from the additional color channels(e.g.. Amber). Set to 50% / Max, maximum Intensity together with the RGB color is adjusted. Set to 100% / Primary, only RGB channels are used for mixing.</li>
		<li>There is also a new button which decides color mixing preferences
		<ul>
			<li>"Prefer MIX color" = prefer Mix color and set all color wheels to open white.</li>
			<li>"Mixcolor only" = only ColorRGB attributes are controlled by this dialog.</li>
			<li>"Colorwheel only" = only Color wheels (color 1, 2, 3) and scrollers are controlled by this dialog.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The values of the "Hue" Fader are displayed from 0-360. When option "Link Encoder HSB" is active the encoder wraps around."</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Setup</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Patch and Fixture Schedule</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>"Setup / Show / Patch + Fixture Schedule: with "Cut...", "Copy...", and "Paste..." row can be moved or copied.Button names change automatically according to context (left area "Layers" or right area "Layer".When one or more rows are marked red ("cut") they can be pasted anywhere else.When copying fixtures or layers the ID Numbers and the Patch will be ignored (not allowed to exist twice). When pressing "paste" after having copied and selected a new row a pop-up will ask whether to overwrite or to insert the line(s).</li>
			<li>Export Patch and Fixture Schedule to File for viewing (HTML-Browser), or printing (Excel). Till now this was possible via predefined macros. Setup/Show/Patch + Fixture Schedule or Patch only: "Export Layer" or "Export Fixture", depends on selected row, one or more Layers / Fixtures can be exported. A pop-up will ask for a file-name if multiple rows are selected. When a USB Stick exists, it will be asked whether to store to USB drive or to internal hard drive. In an additional pop-up a style must be selected.
			<ul>
				<li>"Only Xml" = will create a xml file only.</li>
				<li>"fixture + layer + layers@html@default.xsl" = an HTML File for usage with an HTML Browser.</li>
				<li>"fixture + layer + layers@csv.xsl = a CSV File which can be e.g. imported to Excel.</li>
				<li>A folder "Fixture" or "Fixture_Layers" will be created automatically , depending on exported type.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Select Fixture Type pop-up when exchanging fixture types (Edit Setup) displays the amount of DMX channels and the amount of instances per fixture type. e.g. FixtureType10(DMX 20 Ins. 2)</li>
			<li>If "Patch Readout Absolute Address" is activated in the patch menu the "Universe" Encoder will be suppressed. DMX address of all universes can be addressed via the"Address" Encoder only. Also the DMX addresses on the right side of the menu are displayed absolute.</li>
			<li>3D environment can be modified inside Setup/Patch Fixture Schedule / Fixture Positions. 3D objects are listed in a separate layer inside this dialog.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Fixture Types</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>2 new columns in "Fixture Types" menu: "DMX Footprint" and "Instance". Number of DMX addresses and instances is shown.</li>
			<li>In the Info area attribute to DMX address mapping of the selected fixture type is shown. Virtual attributes are shown below.</li>
			<li>FixtureType and FixtureLayer Export - exporting multi selection creates one file per object.</li>
			<li>The "Clean-up" button converts fixture types from former show files to collect duplicate features to provide a better overview in the calculator.</li>
			<li>Attribute editor: "Identified As" column of sub-attributes show also the unit of the physical value in "[]" if there is one</li>
			<li>When opening Import Fixture Dialog: keyboard focus is at manufacturer filter and screen encoder focus is at fixture type grid.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Fixture Type Editor</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Carallon lib 9.6 fixture library included.</li>
			<li>MIB can be disabled per attribute inside fixture type editor.</li>
			<li>"React to Master" can now be switched on/off for color attributes even if there is no dimmer channel.</li>
			<li>When fixture types are imported from the library into a show file they have extended channel sets. Minimum and maximum values for attributes with physical values are now displayed as e.g.. "open Iris", "min Strobe", "max Frost". The ranges of the physical sub-attributes are shown with units e.g. Unit of Position, Zoom and Iris is "degrees", Strobe is "Hertz" and Gobo rotation is "RPM". Also channel-sets and mode dependencies of animation wheels have been extended</li>
			<li>Fixture types with CMY color mixing system: A lot of fixtures have mode dependencies on their color channels or having integrated macro functions mapped to the upper part of CMY attributes DMX channels CMY attributes of these fixture types are converted to RGB by converting only the range of the DMX channel controlling the color.</li>
			<li>Setup/Patch and Fixture Schedule/ Fixture Type editor sub-attribute selection dialog is similar to attribute selection dialog.</li>
			<li>Fixture Type: Overlapping functions of channels or non-unique natural to DMX mapping result in non-operate-able fixture type. Diagnostic screen will show error message for the user, when having such an error in fixture type.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Cloning</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Cloning of fixtures: Setup / Show / Cloning: the menu "Prepare Cloning" is divided into 2 parts: Left part of view displays the source - right part of view the destination fixtures. Fixture have to be selected and applied to the left or right side using the left or right side "take selection" button. Prepare will lead to the cloning menu. Here can be chosen whether the prepared fixtures are cloned in all sequences/presets/worlds/... or only in selected ("chosen sequences/presets/worlds/..."). The button "Clone" will open the "Perform cloning" pop-up.The clone priority can be defined here:
			<ul>
				<li>"Low Prio. Merge" = simple cloning with low priority. Takes only values which are containing in the source fixture and are free in the destination fixture (no existing data of destination will be overwritten or deleted).</li>
				<li>"Merge" = Mixes Values from the source fixture into the destination fixture and overwrites also already existing values.Values only containing in the destination fixture and not in the source fixture are not overwritten</li>
				<li>Overwrite" = All values of the destination fixture are overwritten with the existing and non-existing values of the source fixture"</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Import/Export Gobo Bitmaps</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Setup / Show / Import Export includes a user interface for importing and exporting Gobo Bitmaps" Exporting Gobo bitmaps to USB drives will export to /gma2/gobos/user_gobos folder. Gobo bitmaps have to be copied to this folder at the USB drive to be able to import them to a grandMA2 onPC or console.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Import/Export User Profiles</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>User Profiles can be exported and imported at / Show / Import/Export/User Profile. Export menu displays all user profiles of current show file on the left and all user profile xml files stored at /gma2/user_profile folder of current selected drive at the right column. Enabling "Always ask for Name" will provide possibility to custom label xml file when exporting. Import menu displays all user profile xml files stored at /gma2/user_profile folder of current selected drive at the left column. Button to the right toggles between import user profile only an import user profile and create user. Enabling Always ask for name provides possibility to rename user profile and user when importing user profile. Export and import of user profiles is limited to one user profile per file when using this dialogue. If you would like to export multiple user profiles into one single xml file, please refer to grandMA2 online help command line syntax for exporting and importing multiple user profiles. When trying to import a file containing multiple user profiles using Import/export menu, only the first user profile of this file will be imported. All exported user profile xml files will be stored to /gma2/user_profile folder of your hard drive or usb drive. User profiles which have been exported with grandMA2 v2.8.3 or earlier have to be manually copied from /gma2/importexport to /gma2/user_profile to be able to import these profiles in grandMA2 v2.9.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>User + User Profiles</strong>

			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>MA Network Configuration/DMX Nodes</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>DMX Node configuration can be exported to and imported from a XML file. Setup / Network / MA Network Configuration / DMX Nodes: the button "Export Config" saves the configuration of the DMX Nodes tab inside the "gma2 / network_nodes" folder. The button "Import Config" loads exported configuration files and overwrites current DMX Nodes configuration with the one from the file.</li>
				<li>&nbsp;</li>
				<li>MA 8-Port-Nodes can be configured using / Setup / Network / MA Network Configuration / DMX Nodes</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Auto Create/Create Preset Reference</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Presets can be added to fixture types as preset reference. Setup/ Autocreate provides access to create a preset reference and to create presets from a preset reference. Preset reference is part of the fixture type and will be exported and imported inside the fixture type file.</li>
			<li>Preset references can be created via command line. At first a fixture of a fixture type must be selected. With the command "Store Fixturetype x.5" all presets of the currently selected fixtures are added to this fixture type. If a reference already exists, a pop-up occurs. The command can be restricted to single presettypes :"Store Fixturetype x.5 if Presettype "color". With "Autocreate Preset Fixturetype x" all preset of that type will be generated and to eventually existing merged (same name). With the extension "/add" always new presets are added. This can be limited with "if" for each presettype. Presets are identified by their name of each presettype and applicable overwritten. Example: "Store Fixturetype x.5 /remove if Presettype "color".</li>
			<li>Autocreate Presets creates preset label by merging channelset and attribute label.</li>

		<li><strong>Layout View Improvements</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Layout view: Following elements can be shown and visualized as a pool icons:effects, bitmap effects, filter, forms, groups, images, macros, channel pages, executor pages, sequences, timecodes and worlds"</li>
			<li>Clean-up of Stage View and Layout view title bar buttons and view options</li>
			<li>1. Move and Select title buttons were combined into one list title button without icons</li>
			<li>2. Zoom In, Zoom Out title buttons have been exchanged by zoom bar (already known from stage stage view) zoom bar can be hidden via layout view options. Deactivate zoom on the screen encoder. 4.</li>
			<li>Title button was renamed to "Reset camera" Title buttons in the layout view are customizable now.</li>
			<li>The Layout View options have been divided into 5 areas.</li>
			<li>Pool Element defaults: Basic adjustments for pool elements are defined if they have been added with the "assign" command into a new layout</li>
			<li>Fixt. / Chan. defaults: Basic adjustments for fixtures and channels when they are added with the "store" command</li>
			<li>Layout Data: basic adjustments for the layout itself e.g. "visible marker"</li>
			<li>Tools: basic adjustments for the layout e.g. zoom Bar, zoom Encoder ,Scrollbar deactivation. Display of Dimmer value regarding fixture sheet ("Cue colors")</li>
			<li>Title Buttons: Button in the title bar can be enabled/disabled. New are also "Pool Playbacks" in the headline</li>
			<li>Frames in Layout View: In the "Setup" mode of the layout view frames can be created(via the Encoder bar). Frames are always displayed on the lowest level. To edit this level the option "Edit Rectangle" must be active. Images then can be selected in the edit menu or via the encoder bar. If the frame shall only visualize one background image, the selection of the frame can be switched off in the edit menu ("Group Select" -&gt; "off")</li>
			<li>New structure of elements in layout: The display of a pool / fixture Element can have different levels. The lowest is the visualization of fixtures: Brightness, color and gobos above those Images and Icons are displayed. These can contain alpha channels, means they can be transparent. Text, Id Numbers and Dimmer Values are on Top.</li>
			<li>Edit of Channel / Fixture elements: Pressing "Edit" and onto a fixture in the layout view the fixture editor comes up. Same in"Setup" Mode opens the editor for the selected layout element. The assignment to a fixture can be exchanged by changing the ID Number. Additional Text and adjustments like visualization, size or image / icon rotation per element are possible. In Tab "Subfixture" Element Channel Id and Fixture Id can be switched on or off</li>
			<li>Editing of Pool Objects: Pressing "Edit" and then onto a pool element in the layout view, e.g. a preset, a "normal edit" will be executed, means the preset is taken into the programmer. Same in "Setup" Mode opens the editor for the selected pool element. E.g. a preset can be exchanged via the Id as well. "Visualization": "Simple" -&gt; shows the object as usual. "Pool Icon" shows the pool element like in its own pool. For preset and bitmap elements the display of the symbols can be adjusted via Tab "Pool" "Spot", and "Filled".</li>
			<li>Dimmer values and dimmer bar can be visualized for group pool elements "Filled" add colors and "Spot" Gobos in addition. The values of the last channels / fixtures in the group are used. Same for display of markers, when there are switched on in the layout.</li>
			<li>Copy in layout view : In setup mode pool elements, text, frame elements can be copied with the "copy" button. Press "Copy", select pool element, click onto new position in layout. Fixtures and channels cannot be copied. These can only be used once per layout</li>
			<li>Copy of Layout Views: With command "Copy Layout 1 at 2 /merge" it is possible to merge 2 different layouts. Layouts can be imported with PSR (Partial Show Read) as well.</li>
			<li>Cloning fixtures can also be used to clone layouts.</li>
			<li>Video attribute thumbnails are displayed in a layout now (like in a Preset pool).</li>
			<li>Command "Assign" and multiple touch of object works same as "Move"</li>
			<li>Image Recommendations for gMA2 layout view:

Resolutions larger than FullHD (1920 x 1080) are downscaled automatically. With "Store" or "Edit" a pool object can be created or modified. With the button "Load Image" in the editor Pictures can be loaded into the pool from the "Bitmaps" Folder of the desk or the "gMA2" Folder of a memory stick. They are then part of the show file. The resolution and the size is displayed. In the option menu of the image pool the symbol size can be chosen (small / big) "</li>
			<li>Command section window height limit has been removed. Command section can be scaled up to any screen size bigger Minimum size of command section is 2x3 grid cells.</li>
			<li>OnScreen keyboard has been added to Info View multi-line editor.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Command line</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Store Presettype X Please will store at the next empty pool object of the referring pool.</li>
		<li>Storing a new preset generates a default name containing type of preset and index of preset inside preset pool. E.g. Store Preset 2.5 will generate a Position preset labelled "Position 5"</li>
		<li>Move/copy/insert can be used to copy ONE empty object.</li>
		<li>New command line command BlackScreen [Screennumber]. The command BlackScreen will blackout all screens. The command BlackScreen 5 will blackout screen 5. Screens can be reactivated using the button ´"Show Screen" or "Show All Screens" in the bottom right corner of each screen of by using the command BlackScreen Off.</li>
		<li>Command line Feedback displays not existing commands also. A yellow message shows "Command not executed". If SpecialMaster 2.4 is on ("SpecialMaster "Snd out" at 100"), error sounds will be replayed (Not in grandMA2 onPC)</li>
		<li>New command IfOutput Fade(Delay) [time range] [Executer] selects all fixtures of a sequence currently using an individual fade or delay time. E.g. Ifoutput Fade 3 Executor 1 selects all fixtures stored or tracked with an individual fade time of 3 seconds at current cue of the sequence assigned to executor 1. Ifoutput Fade Executor 1 selects all fixtures stored or tracked with any individual fade time at current cue of the sequence assigned to executor 1. Ifoutput Fade 1 thru 10 selects all fixtures stored or tracked with an individual fade time between 1 and 10 seconds at current cue of selected executor.</li>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<div class="warning">The command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and the select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers for fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">Selecting multiple fixtures with a lasso in the layout view is respecting the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">The 4Port and 8Port Nodes do not supporting the SACN protocol by now.</div>

<div class="warning">The gma2 folder on your USB stick needs 3 additional new folders:
<ul>
	<li>a. gma2/user_profile (copy your old user profile xml files from the gma2/importexport folder to this new folder)</li>
	<li>b. gma2/network_nodes (this folder will be used to Import/Export the Node Configurations)</li>
	<li>c. gma2/fixture_layers (this folder will be used when you Export Layer in the Patch and Fixture Schedule menu)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warning">Network switch IGMP Snooping functionality has to be switched off to be able to update MA 2Port nodes.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>Release version&nbsp;<strong>2.3</strong>&nbsp;of grandMA2 divorced values and effect values! Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!</li>
	<li>With Version&nbsp;<strong>2.5.70</strong>&nbsp;the default speed of effects and the rate of effect lines has been exchanged by a single speed per line. Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Please check your show file with the new version before using it live!!</li>
	<li>ASCII show import supports Strand, Transtechnik and ADB ASCII show files only.</li>
	<li>MA onPC command wing DMX input is supported for the ports "DMX In" and "DMX out A" only. The port "DMX out B" is allowed to be used as DMX out only!</li>
	<li>Before loading show files stored with grandMA2&nbsp;<strong>v2.7.x</strong>&nbsp;the first time with grandMA2 v2.9.x, attribute Colormix4 and 5 and Colordim4 and 5 of self-made fixture types have to be manually adjusted to fulfill color specification Amber has to be Colormix 4 invert or Colordim 4 without invert, and White has to be Colormix 5 invert or Colordim 5 without invert. Otherwise color information of these fixture types will be lost after loading show file with v2.9.</li>
	<li>The Feature name for ColorDim/ColorMix has changed into MixColor. Macros using one of these feature names have to be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Known limitation when loading show files stored with&nbsp;<strong>v2.8.x</strong>&nbsp;for the first time in v2.9
	<ul>
		<li>Special Masters have a new data structure in grandMA2 software.
		<ul>
			<li>All Special Master custom labels will be reset to MA default labels</li>
			<li>Assignment of 100mm faders will be reset to default.</li>
			<li>Macros, referring to special masters have to be adjusted and have to use the new naming and numbering of special masters.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Macros referring to relative values have to be adjusted according to new relative/absolute syntax.</li>
		<li>User profiles exported to USB drives have to be manually moved from importexport folder to user_profile folder to be able to import these profiles using grandMA2 v2.9</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>4Port and 8Port Nodes have to be updated to v1.0.9 to be compatible with grandMA2 v2.9. 2-Port Nodes have to be updated to 1.74 to be compatible with grandMA2 v2.9.</li>
	<li>Channelset labels of fixture types have to be unique to be visible and accessible in calculator. E.g. Channel sets of Attribute Shutter = closed, open, open, open,… only one open is visible in the calculator. Changing channel set labels to closed, open, open(2), open(3),… will result in all channel sets are visible in the calculator.</li>
