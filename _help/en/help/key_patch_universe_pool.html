		<h1>Universe Pool</h1>
		
		<p>The Universe pool displays all the 256 universes that the system can handle.</p>

<p>You can create a Universe pool on your screens using the <strong>Create Basic Window</strong> pop-up. It is described in the <a href="key_windows.html">Manages windows topic</a>.</p>

<p>It is a pool. To learn general thing about the pools please read the <a href="key_pools.html">Pools in General section</a>.</p>

<p>Each universe with something patched is displayed as a pool object.</p>

<p>The Universe pool could look like this (Pool Mode):</p>

<p>If you change the pool to be displayed in sheet style (in the pool options) it could look like this:</p>

<p>Each pool object (universe) has some icons and indicators displaying different properties of the universe. They correlate to the columns displayed in the sheet style.</p>
