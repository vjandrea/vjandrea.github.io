		<h1>How to create a session</h1>
		
		<p>To create a session you need to give your station (console or onPC) a valid <strong>IP address</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are using an onPC then your station will get the <strong>Hostname</strong> from the computer name. On a console you can change the stations Hostname by tapping the green input field.</p>

<p>Giving your station a meaning full name can help locating the console or onPC in bigger systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next you will need to select a<strong> session number </strong>that is not already used. Valid numbers are from 1 through 31.</p>

<p>You can also give your session a <strong>name</strong>. This can be very useful in networks with more than one session. If you do not specify a session name, then the name from the show file is used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A session can also have a <strong>password</strong>. Please read the <a href="key_network_session_protect.html">Protect the session and your station</a> topic to learn more about this.</p>

<p>Now you can tap the <span class="softkey">Create Session</span> button.</p>

<p>Your station will create a session and upload the show file to all devices that are linked to your session. Read more about this in the <a href="key_network_session_add_device.html">Adding devices to your session</a>.</p>
