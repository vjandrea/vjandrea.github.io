		<h1>Saving a show</h1>
		
		<h3>Using the GUI</h3>

<p>The Save Show button immediately saves the show using the current show name.</p>

<p>There is a green input line in the top part of the Backup Menu. This is used to add information to the show file. This info is visible when loading or deleting a show file and can be used to mark different version or information to the saves.</p>

<p>It creates a backup of the previous saved show. Each show file (or unique file name) can have 10 backups. So it is possible to load a backup from ten saves ago.</p>

<h3>Using the command line</h3>

<p>A show file can be saved with the same name using the command line. The command is <span class="syntax">SaveShow</span>. Read about it <a href="key_keyword_saveshow.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Using the Quick Save function</h3>

<p>There is also a fast way to save the show. It is called "Quick Save".</p>

<p>When the backup menu is <strong>not</strong> open then press the <span class="hardkey">Backup</span> key twice (like a double click on a mouse) will perform the Quick Save.</p>
