		<h1>Executors</h1>
		
		<p>This section explains some of the most common executor concepts and functions. The section called <a href="key_adv_exec.html">Advanced Executor Functionality</a> explains the rest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Executors are handles used to control and execute stored content.</p>

<p>The most obvious use for an executor is to assign a sequence with cues for playback. However executors may also be used as handles for other objects, for example a physical key for a specific macro or a speedfader for a group of chasers.</p>

<p>Executors are arranged in Executor Pages. This enables you to easy get a new set of executors merely by changing page.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
Changing page will not load new content into the physical executors, like on some other consoles. Changing page just instructs the console to <strong>display </strong>another set of executors on your physical hardware. This enables you to have executors from multiple pages active and running at the same time.</div>

<p>Read more about this in the <a href="key_adv_exec_pages.html">Executor Pages topic</a> (Advanced Executor Functionality section).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more detailed explanation of the executors are found in the <a href="key_exec_what_are.html">What are Executors topic</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Executors are physical keys and faders, but they can also be represented as virtual executors on the screens - <a href="key_exec_on_screen.html">Executors on the Screens</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways to see all the active executors, this also provides a fast way to turn Off executors - read about it in the <a href="key_exec_running_playbacks.html">Looking at the Active Executors topic</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assigning an object to an executor and changing the function on the faders and keys are explained in the <a href="key_exec_assign.html">Assign a Function topic</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally some of the common options that are not already covered in this section and in the <a href="key_cues_and_sequences.html">Cues and Sequences section</a>, are explained in the <a href="key_exec_common_options.html">Common Executor Options topic</a>.</p>
