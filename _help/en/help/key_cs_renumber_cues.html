		<h1>Renumber cues</h1>
		
		<p>Cue numbers can be changed. This cannot be used to move the cues around and change the cue order.</p>

<p>When editing a cue number in the Sequence Executor Sheet, a pop-up like this will appear:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_edit-cue-numbers_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Edit Cue Numbers pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A range of cues can be selected for renumbering, but remember that the new numbers cannot exceed the numbers before and after the selection.</p>

<p>The two top input fields in this pop-up can be used to set a range or simply have a range of one.</p>

<p>Below this is the renumber section. Here is the option to set the "New Number". This will be the number of the first cue if a range of cues are selected.</p>

<p>A "Step Width" can be defined. This is relevant if a range of cues are selected. This will then be used to set the step size between the cue range.</p>

<p>With the input fields correctly filled out, tapping the <span class="softkey">Renumber</span> button will do the renumbering - this will also close the pop-up.</p>

<h2>Other Functions</h2>

<p>The Other Functions section at the bottom have four buttons.</p>

<p>"Change Color" is described below.</p>

<p>"Block Cue(s)", "Unblock Cue(s)" are related to tracking. This is described in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>.</p>

<p>"Delete Cue(s)" will delete the selected cues. This is discussed in the <a href="key_cs_delete_cues.html">Delete Cues topic</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="cue_color" name="cue_color"></a>Change cue color</h2>

<p>A cue can have a color assigned to the row in the Sequence Executor Sheet.</p>

<p>This can be done using the command line or by tapping the <span class="softkey">Change Color</span> button in the Edit Cue Numbers pop-up.</p>

<p>The <a href="key_keyword_appearance.html">Appearance keyword</a> is used to do this via the command line.</p>

<p>Unless you use the command line input to specify a color then the <strong>Select Color pop-up</strong> appears.</p>

<p>The sheet options control if this color is visible and how may cells will have the background color. Read more about this in the <a href="key_of_sheet_options_display.html#cue_color_columns">Sheet Options - Display - Cue Color Columns</a>.</p>
