		<h1>Let&#39;s create a new empty show</h1>
		
		<p>The first thing you need to do is the press the&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Backup</span>&nbsp;key so the Backup&nbsp;Menu can be seen on the 9" screen in the command section - this is called screen 1. Menus&nbsp;often appear on screen 1</p>

<p>Then make sure the <span class="softkey">Internal</span> tab is selected.</p>

<p>Now tap the <span class="softkey">New Show</span> button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This opens the "New Show" pop-up. Here you can write the name of the new show and choose to clear different areas of the current show.</p>

<p>In the name box, write this: <span class="syntax">Quick Start Guide 1</span></p>

<p>If you are using console that you share with other people, then please add your name in front of this. This will make sure that you are creating a new show file instead of overwriting an existing one - in case someone else already did this guide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make sure you check all the boxes in the pop-up.</p>

<p>This ensures that the new show is empty and with all the default options. It basically makes sure you do not bring anything from the currently loaded show into our new show.</p>

<p>The fast way to this is to tap the <span class="softkey">Check All</span> button</p>

<p>Your pop-up should look something like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../../img/grandma2_quick_start_guide/qsg_01_create_new_show_popup_3_2_1.png" />
<figcaption><em>New Show pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then you can tap the <span class="softkey">Please</span> button. If there already exists a show using the name you typed, then a warning will appear asking what to do. You can go back and write a different name or overwrite the existing show.</p>

<p>Close the Backup Menu by pressing the yellow <span class="softkey">X</span> in the upper right corner when you have created a show file. The yellow 'X' is how you always closes temporary windows and pop-ups.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have now created a new empty show.</p>
