		<h1>A second sequence</h1>
		
		<p>We are going&nbsp;create a second sequence and link the two sequences.</p>

<h2>Making the second sequence.</h2>

<p>Clear your programmer. Press the first position preset twice.</p>

<p>Now press&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Store</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Exec</span> <span class="hardkey">3</span> <span class="hardkey">Please</span>. If you are on a console you can just press the 'Store' key and then one of the executor buttons labeled "3".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now you got a second sequence.</p>

<p>Let us build some more into it. Select executor fader 3 by pressing&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Select</span>&nbsp;followed by one of the executor buttons associated with executor fader 3. Press the first Gobo and Color presets followed by&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Store</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Please</span>. Then we got this pop-up:</p>

<figcaption><em>Store Method pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here you choose how you want to store things. Tap <span class="softkey">Merge</span>.</p>

<p>That was our first cue in the second sequence. Clear the programmer. Press the second Position preset twice followed by the second Gobo and Color presets and then <span class="hardkey">Store</span> <span class="hardkey">Please</span>. This time choose <span class="softkey">Create Second Cue</span>&nbsp;in the store method pop-up.</p>

<p>Make a third cue with the third Position, Gobo and Color presets. Again you can use <span class="hardkey">Store</span> <span class="hardkey">Please</span>, and this time it will not ask what to do. When you have more than one cue, then it will just create a new cue with the next available whole number.</p>

<p>The last cue you need to make is a cue containing the "All" preset. All the cue times need to be 0 seconds! Clear your programmer when you are gone.</p>

<h2>Setting up the sequences (Assign Menu).</h2>

<p>Select your first executor. Now press the green name field above the executor fader (where it says "Main Show"):</p>

<figcaption><em>Executor 1</em></figcaption>

<p>On screen 1 you see some of the options for that executor. This window can be a bit confusing the first you see it, but right now we are only interested in is the size of the executor.</p>

<p>Make sure the you are at the correct view by tapping <span class="softkey">Function</span> in the upper right corner.</p>

<p>Now we can change the width of the executor by pressing the <span class="hardkey">X2</span> key (or where it says "Width 2").</p>

<p>Now we need to change the default button assignment. The buttons and fader can have a lot of different functions (explaining those goes beyond the scope of this quick&nbsp;start guide). Tap where it says <span class="softkey">XF</span> and in the small pop-up select <span class="softkey">Rate</span>.</p>

<p>Press where it says <span class="softkey">GoBack</span>&nbsp;and choose the option called <span class="softkey">Rate1</span>. Change the rest of the buttons so they end up looking like this:</p>

<figcaption><em>Executor assignment</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Close the&nbsp;<strong>Assign Menu</strong> using the yellow <span class="softkey">X</span>.</p>

<p>What is a Rate fader? Well, the rate fader is used for changing the overall speed of the cues. You can speed it up or slow it down to a complete stop. The cue times are not changed in the sequence permanently, just adjusted according to the rate fader position.</p>

<p>The button called "Rate1" resets the fader to the mid position, where all the times are back at their saved times.</p>

<p>The '&lt;&lt;&lt;' and '&gt;&gt;&gt;' steps one cue back and forward accordingly, without time and without running the follow cue.</p>

<h2>Linking and editing the two sequences.</h2>

<p>Did you noticed that you did not save any dimmer values to the fixtures in the second sequence (we did actually store a dimmer value in the last cue - the default dimmer value)? We are going to put those in our first sequence and we are going to do some sequence linking.</p>

<p>In your&nbsp;<strong>Sequence Executor</strong>&nbsp;window make sure you can see the "CMD" (command) column.</p>

<p>Right-click in the "CMD" cell for cue 1 and in the pop-up write:&nbsp;<span class="syntax">Goto cue 1 exec 1.3</span>&nbsp;followed by a 'Please'/enter. In the "CMD" cell for cue 3 right-click and write:&nbsp;<span class="syntax">Goto cue 2 exec 1.3</span>&nbsp;also followed by a 'Please'/enter. In cue 4 the command is cue 3 on executor 1.3. And in cue 6 we need a command to cue 4. When you are done it should look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../../img/grandma2_quick_start_guide/qsg_14_second-sequence_commands_v3-2_1.png" />
<figcaption><em>The needed commands</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now press the big&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Go+</span>&nbsp;key in the console or in the <strong>Masters</strong> section in the onPC. Notice that booth sequences go to cue number 1. That is the command making sure the second sequence is also running.</p>

<p>Press the&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>&nbsp;executor button. Turn on your moving light at full. Press&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Update</span>. Tap where it says <span class="softkey">Original Content Only</span>&nbsp;until it changes to "Add new Content". Then tap&nbsp;<span class="softkey">Save as Default</span>.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only update existing values, but also add new values to our sequences.</p>

<p>Now there are two possible sequences to update. Make sure you update the one called "Sequ 1 'Main Show'". This can be done by simply tapping the correct line.</p>

<p>Go to cue 6. Notice that the moving light gets the dimmer value "0.1 Default" (or if you gave it a different name). This is actually the value 0% stored in the All preset. To make sure that no matter what, they go to 0, let us store this value in the first sequence also.</p>

<p>Press:&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Thru</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">3</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">3</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">.</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">.</span>&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Update</span>. Now you can see that you also have the option to update the preset. <strong>Do not do that</strong>; just update the cue in sequence 1.</p>

<p>Clear your programmer and try moving back and forward in your sequence to see how the link works.</p>

<p>Notice that the moving heads still get the dimmer value from the All preset. This is because sequence 1 first give them 0% and then immediately calls the cue in sequence 2. So the last information they got is from sequence 2 - the value from the All preset.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that the value from sequence 1 is the one they got, then you can give the executor a higher priority.</p>

<p>Press <span class="hardkey">Assign</span> followed by any of the executor buttons labeled 1 or 2. This opens the <strong>Assign Menu</strong> where you assigned the button and fader functionality. This is also where you can change the Executor options. Tap where it says <span class="softkey">Options</span> on the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>This opens the a window with many options. The one you need to change is the top one in the second column - column named "Playback". Tap where it says <span class="softkey">Priority LTP</span>&nbsp;and in the small select pop-up select the one called "High". You might get a warning that this will turn off the executor - please confirm this. Nice to know if you are in a live situation :-)&nbsp;Close the Assign Menu.</p>

<p>Now you can test your sequence and see that now when you run cue 6 the dimmer value reads "closed".</p>

<p>There is no need to separate the moving lights from the conventionals. It was just a way to demonstrate the possibilities.</p>

<h2>Last thoughts</h2>

<p>It might not be a pretty show, but you should save it anyway. And you should do this at a regular interval during your programming. You can use the double press on the <span class="hardkey">Backup</span> key or use the <strong>Backup menu</strong>.</p>

<p>Now you got a small introduction to the grandMA2. It is a very advanced and flexible console. There are many function and details we have not explored in this guide.</p>

<p>The rest of the manual will help you finding your way around the functions. There is also a lot of help in the <a href="http://www.malighting.com/support-downloads/videos.html">videos on MA lighting </a>(external link to the Internet)&nbsp;plus the big international community.</p>

<p>Have fun learning and programming on the grandMA2.</p>
