		<h1>Preset and Preset Pool</h1>
		
		<p>A preset is a way to store a set of values.</p>

<h2>What are Presets</h2>

<p>There a 10 default groups of presets. They are named "All", "Dimmer", "Position", "Gobo", "Color", "Beam", "Focus", "Control", "Shapers" &amp; "Video".&nbsp;Basically each preset group can only store their own kind of info - for instance a "Position" preset can only store Position values.</p>

<p>The exception to this is the "All" presets. They can store info about all the types of values.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Create Basic Window pop-up</strong> you can also see that there is something called "Dynamic". This is not a preset pool in it self. It is a pool window that changes to the pool of the Preset Type you select in the Preset Type Control bar.</p>

<p>The Preset Pool windows are a lot like the Group Pool window. There are of course differences.</p>

<p>If you do not have any fixtures selected and press a preset in the pool, then you select the fixtures that can use the preset. Second press will apply a preset link to the attribute in your programmer. This means that you<strong> are not coping</strong> the values stored in the preset to the attribute - you tell the fixture to go look in the preset to see the values. We try this in chapter 14.</p>

<p>If you have a selection of fixtures and you press a preset, then it will apply&nbsp;the preset link (if the fixtures can use them) to the fixtures.</p>

<h2>Create Preset Pools</h2>

<p>In this guide we are going to use "All", "Position", "Gobo" and "Color" presets. You can also try to create a "Dynamic" pool, just for fun.</p>

<p>How you arrange them is all up to you. You know how to create and store views.</p>

<p>To increase&nbsp;fast visual recognition it can be a good idea to color the frames of the different preset pool. This can be done from the pool options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You enter the&nbsp;Pool Options&nbsp;by pressing the yellow ball in the pool title button:</p>

<figcaption><em>Pool title button</em></figcaption>

<p>In the options pop-up you need to tap where it says <span class="softkey">Frame Color</span>. Now you have indicated that you are working on the color for the frame. Now you can select a new color using any method you like in the left side of the options pop-up.</p>

<p>Set a frame color for the preset pools we need. Notice that you do not need to set it for the Dynamic pool, it follows the color of the selected preset type.</p>

<p>When you are done, your view could look something like this:</p>
