		<h1>Choose copy method</h1>
		
		<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Copy a group object in the group pool</li>
	<li>Target group object has to be occupied</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information how to copy pool objects see <a href="key_pools_manage.html">Manage pool objects</a>.</p>

<p>When you copy a group to a location where there's already a group then a pop-up opens. This pop-up shows three options:</p>

<p><strong>Overwrite - </strong>This will delete the current content in the group at the location and add the new content. It' won't change the group name.</p>

<p><strong>Merge</strong> - Adds new fixtures to the existing fixtures in the group. The order of the selected fixtures depends on which fixtures you selected first, e.g., the new fixtures are attached to the existing fixtures in their selection order. It won't change the group name.</p>

<p><strong>Cancel - </strong>This will cancel the copy operation. You can also cancel copy by closing the pop-up by tapping the X in the upper right corner.</p>
