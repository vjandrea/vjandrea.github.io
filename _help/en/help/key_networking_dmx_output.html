		<h1>What affects my DMX output?</h1>
		
		<h2>The following affects the DMX output:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>A crash or a failure – this discontinues&nbsp;DMX output.</li>
	<li>Show upload – this&nbsp;stops&nbsp;DMX&nbsp;output.</li>
	<li>Changing the value of a fixture <strong>– </strong>this&nbsp;changes the DMX&nbsp;output.</li>
</ul>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
In case of a failure or crash, the DMX&nbsp;lines should go off. This is called High-Z.&nbsp;</div>

<h3>What happens to the fixtures?</h3>

<p>Fixtures have a function called the DMX hold.</p>

<h3>What is a DMX hold?</h3>

<p>The end-device physically emits the latest value, e.g., the fixture is on or off.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong><br />
DMX hold&nbsp;is the function of the end-device only, e.g., a fixture.</div>

<p>How do I set the DMX hold on my end-device?&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set it either individually on your end-device <strong>–</strong>&nbsp;on or off.</li>
	<li>The end-device goes back to default automatically&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp;</strong>off.</li>
	<li>If you have two individual inputs in your end-device, the DMX input automatically chooses the second input in case of a crash or failure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip"><strong>Note:</strong><br />
If your end-device does not support the feature DMX hold, add a DMX booster or splitter featuring DMX hold.</div>

<h3>How does the output behave in case of a single console?</h3>

<p>If a problem occurs, the console´s DMX outputs should go High-Z.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How do I create backup?</h3>

<p>With the&nbsp;grandMA2 system you have a seamless switch between the transmitting console (master) and the back-up console (connected) in case of a failure or crash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are three examples on how to create backup:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the grandMA2 console as master and the grandaMA2 onPC&nbsp;software version as connected, and DMX nodes for emission of the signal.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Use the grandMA2 console as master with a second grandMA2 console as connected, and DMX nodes for emission of the signal.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Use the grandMA2 replay unit (RPU) as master together with the grandMA2 onPC software as connected, and DMX nodes for emission of the signal.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
