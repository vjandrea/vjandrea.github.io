		<h1>Chasers</h1>
		
		<p>A chaser is a sequence that runs in a loop. It ignores the timing in the sequence and uses the speed setting to run through all the cues. Cues are referred to as steps. Each cue is a step in the chaser. Read more about cues in the <a href="key_cs_what_are.html">What are cues and sequences</a> topic.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
Chasers are used whenever you need a loop with more than two steps. If you only need two steps, then use an effect.</div>
