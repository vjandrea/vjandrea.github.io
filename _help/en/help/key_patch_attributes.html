		<h1>What are Attributes</h1>
		
		<p>Attributes are the different functions in a fixture.</p>

<p>It might just be a dimmer that uses 1 DMX channel, but can be something more complex like the Pan function that often use 2 DMX channels. In the grandMA2 it is just 1 Attribute no matter if it uses 1, 2 or 3 DMX channels.</p>

<p>Attributes are organized in the grandMA2 into a structure. The top level of this structure are called <strong>Preset Type</strong> - This could be something like "Gobo". In the Preset types there's a new level called Feature - a Feature could be something like "Gobo Wheel 1". In Features we find the <strong>Attributes</strong> -&nbsp; this is the specific function where you can select what gobo the fixture should project. There's also something below an Attribute called <strong>Subattributes</strong> - this could be a function of the gobo wheel, like half of the DMX range is select a gobo and the other half is continues wheel rotation.</p>

<p>The grandMA2 have a lot of predefined attributes. You can make your own and you can edit the ones that are there.</p>

<p>For more details about all this please have a look at <a href="key_basic_fixture_attribute_feature_preset.html">What are attributes, features &amp; preset types</a> under the <a href="key_basic_fixture.html">Basic Fixture types</a> topic.</p>
