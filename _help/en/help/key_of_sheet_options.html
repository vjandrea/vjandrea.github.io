<h2>General information about sheet options</h2>

<p>All the options regarding sheets are user based. This means that each user in a system can have their own sheet options to fit their preferences.</p>

<p>The options can be changed from the <a href="key_single_multi_systems_user_settings.html">User Settings</a> in the Setup menu or they can be changed in each sheet. The options changed in the Setup menu are the default settings used when you create a new window on a screen. The options changed in the sheet on the screen are only for that version of the window (remember to store the view after applying changes). However you can copy the options from a sheet to the defaults - read below for more on this.</p>

<p>Any change you do in the options are immediately applied to the sheet. To keep the options it is needed to store the view containing the sheet.</p>

<h2>Options title bar</h2>

<p>The options pop-up has a title bar. This title bar have a few buttons that are worth describing. The title bar buttons look like this:</p>

<p>As mentioned above; the settings applied in the sheet options can be copied to the default settings. This is done by tapping the <span class="softkey">Save to Default</span> button. It is also possible to load the setting from the default into the sheet options. This is done by tapping the <span class="softkey">Load from Default</span> button. This will overwrite any local options.</p>

<p>The <span class="softkey">Delete Window</span> button will remove the sheet from the screen.</p>

<p>The big yellow <span class="softkey">X</span> will close the options pop-up.</p>
