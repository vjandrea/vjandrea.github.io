<hr />
<h2>Default Language</h2>

<p>It is not possible to change this setting, as the console, at the moment, only supports English language.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2>Network DMX if alone</h2>

<p>When this is "On", the console will output DMX&nbsp;over network when only one desk (as master) is in the session.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important</strong><br />
This setting can conflict with other console (as master), sending out DMX in the network.</div>

<hr />
<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In the following example, 3 consoles are in a session, connected with one switch to manage MANet&nbsp;on the first ethernet&nbsp;port, and another one to manage Art-Net on ethernet port 2.&nbsp;All the consoles have <strong>Network&nbsp;DMX&nbsp;if alone</strong> enabled.</p>

<p>If the switch that distribute MANet&nbsp;fails, all 3 consoles will be "Alone" in the network, become Master and will send out Art-Net. This will make a conflict in the fixtures because they will receive Art-Net&nbsp;from 3 different sources. To avoid this conflict, make sure&nbsp;that only one of the consoles have <strong>Network&nbsp;DMX&nbsp;if alone</strong> enabled. This will make sure that when the consoles are "Alone" in the network, only the console with <strong>Network&nbsp;DMX&nbsp;if alone</strong> will send out Art-Net.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Show release notes on start</h2>

<p>Turn <strong>Show Release Notes on Start</strong> "On" or "Off", to see the release notes on startup.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Flashing error LED on wrong fader position</h2>

<p>Turn <strong>Flashing error LED on wrong fader position</strong> "On" or "Off" to let a red LED flash, if the fader is in a wrong position.</p>

This function is only available on a grandMA2 ultra-light&nbsp;and a grandMA2 onPC with a wing.&nbsp;On a grandMA2 ultra-light it relates the red LEDs under the faders. In the grandaMA2 onPC it relates the LEDs in the keys over the faders.</div>

<hr />
<h2>Exec CLI</h2>

<p>Turn <strong>Exec CLI</strong> â€‹(Command Line Interaction) "On" or "Off" to let the Command Line interact with the executors.</p>

<p>In the following &nbsp;example <strong>Exce CLI</strong> is "Off".</p>

<p>If <span class="hardkey">Select</span> is pressed, followed by an&nbsp;<strong>Executor button</strong>, this will NOT select the executor, but perform the action assigned to the button.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Default Go, Goback, Pause CLI</h2>

<p>Turn&nbsp;<strong>Default Go, Goback, Pause CLI</strong>&nbsp;"On" or "Off" to let the Command Line interact with the big&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Default Go</span>, <span class="hardkey">Goback</span> and <span class="hardkey">Pause</span>&nbsp;keys.</p>

<p>In the following &nbsp;example&nbsp;<strong>Default Go,&nbsp;Goback, Pause CLI</strong>&nbsp;is "Off".</p>

<p>If a macro is edited and <span class="hardkey">Default Go</span> is pressed, the system will NOT enter DefaultGo in the macro-line, but execute the next cue in the selected executor.</p>
