		<h1>Getting DMX in and out of the system</h1>
		
		<p>All the 5-pin XLR connectors in a grandMA2 system is a DMX port.</p>

<p>A DMX port can (almost) always be an output, an input or turned off.</p>

<p>What the DMX ports are doing and how they are configured is handle in the MA Network Configuration.</p>

<p>All this is described in the <a href="key_network_dmx_configure_ports.html">Configure the DMX ports on MA devices</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A different way to get DMX in and out of the system is using Ethernet protocols like Art-Net and sACN. Other Ethernet protocols are output only. The grandMA2 system can transmit ETC-Net2, Pathport, Shownet and Kinet1.</p>

<p>Read more about configuring Ethernet protocols on the <a href="key_network_dmx_protocols.html">Network DMX protocols</a> topic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="key_networking_dmx_output.html">What affects my DMX output topic</a> explains a little bit about the different situations that affects the DMX output in a system.</p>
