		<h1>Advanced Fixture Types</h1>
		
		<p>This section provides detailed information about the fixture types also called fixture profiles.</p>

<p>The first topics are about the <strong>Fixture Type Editor</strong> and it also describes the <a href="key_adv_fixture_anatomy.html">Anatomy of Fixture Types</a>.</p>

<p>A very important part of the structure, not only in fixtures, but in the entire show is the setup and arrangement of the Preset Types, Features, Attributes, and Subattributes. This is all arranged in the <a href="key_adv_fixture_attribute_encoder_grouping.html">Attribute &amp; Encoder Grouping</a> menu.</p>
