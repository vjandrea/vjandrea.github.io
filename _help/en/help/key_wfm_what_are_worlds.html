		<h1>What are Worlds</h1>
		
		<p>Worlds are a functionality in the grandMA2 that allows you to limit what is possible to access and what is displayed in windows.</p>

<p>Worlds are organized in a World pool. Since it is a pool, it might be a good idea to read the <a href="key_pools.html">Pools in General section</a>.</p>

<p>It could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_world-pool_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>World pool - pool style</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It can be changed to "Sheet Style" in the pool options. Then it could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_world-pool_sheet-style_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>World pool - sheet style</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first world in the pool is locked from the factory. It contains everything and is used when you do not want to exclude anything - it is called <strong>Full</strong>.</p>

<p>The world pool is shared among all users in the show, but each user can have different worlds selected.</p>

<p>You can select a different world by simply pressing the pool object. The green line indicates the selected world.</p>

<p>If a world, other than number one (Full), is selected, then there is a World Icon&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../../img/icon_world_v3-2.png" /> in the title bar of sheets and other windows that is affected by the world selection. The icon might also be in the Command Line Input - it depends on your Message Center settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worlds can contain a selection of fixtures and/or a selection of Attributes.</p>

<p>If a world only have some (not all) Attributes then the pool object will display the <a href="key_ws_colors_system.html#preset_type_marker">Preset Type Marker</a> at the bottom of the pool object.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using different worlds can be a big help in multi user environment. It can be used to separate the lighting rig into different parts for different programmers.</p>

<p>Another good use is to be in a world without the attributes that is undesired to get programmed in sequences. This could be control channels to accidentally resets fixtures or turns off the lamps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selecting a world will hide fixtures, that are not a part of this world, in sheets and stage view/MA 3D. Attributes that are not in the world will not be visible in sheets.</p>

<p>It is important to know that you can only affect the fixtures and attributes in your selected world. This is valid for programming actions. Read more in the <a href="key_wfm_use_worlds.html">Use worlds when programming topic</a>.</p>

<p>Playback actions (executors and sequences) are not directly affected by your selected world.</p>

<p>You can assign a world to an executor or a sequence - but it is not linked to the worlds your user has selected. Read more in the <a href="key_wfm_apply_to_exec_seq.html">Apply worlds or filters to executors and sequences topic</a>.</p>

<p>Worlds can be assigned to User Profiles. Then the users, with this User Profile, will be limited to only the assigned world and cannot select a different world. Read about it in the <a href="key_single_multi_systems_create.html">Create User Profiles and Users topic</a>.</p>
