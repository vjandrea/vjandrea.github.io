		<h1>Store Options and Defaults</h1>
		
		<p>When cues are stored then there are some options that will be used.</p>

<p>Each user (profile) can have their own default options.</p>

<p>During the store it is also possible to add commands that will use a specific set of store options.</p>

<p>In this topic the options regarding storing cues are described. Some of these options will impact how other cues will respond. Elements regarding tracking are described in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>.</p>

<h2>Store Options</h2>

<p>The default store options are found by pressing the <span class="hardkey">Setup</span> key followed by the <span class="softkey">Store Options</span> below the "User" tab. It could look like this:</p>

</figure>

<p>On the left side are two areas called "Data Source" and "Use Selection". It is these two sections that are described here.</p>

<p>The "Presets" options are described in the <a href="key_presets_create.html">Create Presets topic</a>. "If not Empty" is described in the <a href="key_cs_store.html">Store Cues topic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Store Filter</strong> is described in the <a href="key_wfm_what_are_filters.html">What are Filters topics</a>. <strong>Cue Only</strong> and <strong>Tracking Shield</strong> is discussed in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>. Position data (<strong>Active Position Data</strong>, <strong>XYZ</strong>, and <strong>Pan/Tilt</strong>) is relevant when XYZ position programming is activated. Read more about it in the <a href="key_xyz.html">Programming XYZ section</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>

<p>This is the source that will used when storing.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Prog. (Programmer) - This is the default option: </strong><br />
	Stores the content in the programmer.</li>
	<li><strong>Output:</strong><br />
	Stores the status of the current output from the console. The output can be affected by masters and DMX profiles. The <a href="key_patch_dmx_sheet.html">DMX sheet</a> will show what the output actually is.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>DMX In:</strong><br />
	Stores the current DMX input.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Selection</h3>

<p>This decides what values, from the source, will be used when storing.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Active - This is the default option:</strong><br />
	Stores the values that are active in the programmer, but with respect for the source selected above.</li>
	<li><strong>All for selected:</strong><br />
	Stores all attributes of the fixtures selected in the programmer, also with respect for the source selected above.</li>
	<li><strong>Active for selected:</strong><br />
	Stores only all active attributes but only for the fixtures selected in the programmer, also with respect for the source selected above.</li>
	<li><strong>All:</strong><br />
	Stores all attributes for all fixtures.</li>
	<li><strong>Look:</strong><br />
	Look stores all dimmer attributes and for the fixtures that have a dimmer values above 0 all attributes will be stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Temporary Store Options</h2>

<p>The store options can also be opened as a temporary version.</p>

<p>This can be done by pressing and holding the <span class="hardkey">Store</span> key for approximately one second.</p>

<p>This looks like the normal Store Options except it got two extra buttons in the title bar.</p>

<p>One is the "Change Screen" button that allows you to move the pop-up to a different screen.</p>

<p>The other is called <span class="softkey">Save as Default</span>. This can be used to save the current temporary options as the new default options into the current User Profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Store Encoder Toolbar</h2>

<p>When "Store" is the active keyword, then the Encoder Toolbar will display the "Store Encoder Toolbar". It could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/img_encoder-toolbar_store_1_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Encoder Toolbar - Store - Page 1 Basics</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The top row has a lot of buttons. Short description from left to right:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data Source:</strong><br />
	This is the data source swipe button - read description above.</li>
	<li><strong>Use Selection:</strong><br />
	This is the use selection swipe button - read description above.</li>
	<li><strong>If not Empty:</strong><br />
	This is the if not empty swipe button - read description in the <a href="key_cs_store.html">Store Cues topic</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Store Filter:</strong><br />
	This button opens the Store Filter pop-up - read about it in the <a href="key_wfm_temporary_filters.html">Use Temporary Filters topic</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Layers:</strong><br />
	This on/off button filters the Value Layers - read about the layers in the <a href="key_of_layers_in_sheets.html">Layers in Sheets topic</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Time Layers:</strong><br />
	This on/off button filters the Value Time Layers - read about it by following the link above.</li>
	<li><strong>Effect Layers:</strong><br />
	This on/off button filters the Effect Layers - read about it by following the link above.</li>
	<li><strong>Cue Only:</strong><br />
	This on/off button will activate the Cue Only function. It is mutually exclusive with the Tracking Shield function. Read about Cue Only in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Tracking Shield:</strong><br />
	This on/off button will activate the Tracking Shield function. It is mutually exclusive with the Cue Only function. Read about Tracking Shield following the link above.</li>
	<li><strong>Page change:</strong><br />
	This will toggle the pages for the bottom row.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom row has four options. These can be adjusted using the encoders.</p>

<p>For page one it is the "Fade", "OutFade", "Delay" and "OutDelay" times. The values here are the values that will be used when the store action is carried out.</p>

<p>As mentioned above there are two pages to this Encoder Toolbar. The second page could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/img_encoder-toolbar_store_2_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Encoder Toolbar - Store - Page 2 Next</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is only the bottom row that changes.</p>

<p>Now the encoders control the "SnapPercent", CmdDelay", "Trig", and "TrigTime" values.</p>
