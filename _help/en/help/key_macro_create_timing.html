		<h1>Macro timing</h1>
		
		<p>As you may have noticed within the Edit Macro pop-up, in addition to the command text field, there is also a wait field for each macro line.</p>

<p>By default the macro will proceed immediately and start processing the next line, however this "Follow" may be changed to either a wait time in seconds, or a trigger to pause and wait for next Go (to the macro), before the macro proceeds with next line.</p>

<p>The last wait time is not needed and the value here will be displayed in red text.</p>

<h2>Setting a time</h2>

<p>Wrong timing is the major pitfall when creating complex macros. The console is multi-tasking so when a command immediately follows another, the second command will start processing, even if the previous has not yet finished processing.</p>

<p>If a macro-line depends on an earlier line, to be processed correctly, you may need to add a wait-time, to prevent the next command to follow immediately and be processed too early. If you experience that a command works if you type it manually but not when you run it in a macro, then it can also be a sign that you need to add a small wait time.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Let us create a Macro that Parks Channel 10 at 50%:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">No.</th>
			<th scope="col">CMD</th>
			<th scope="col">Wait</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Channel 10 At 50</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Park Channel 10</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>With the default "Follow" trigger, this macro does not work. Setting channel 10 to 50% takes a little bit of time, and our second macro line parks the channel before the first line has been fully processed.</p>

<p>Giving the first line 50 millisecond to be processed, before proceeding to the next line, solves the problem in this case:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">No.</th>
			<th scope="col">CMD</th>
			<th scope="col">Wait</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Channel 10 At 50</td>
			<td>0.05</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Park Channel 10</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>When creating complex macros it is wise to start with a small timing of something like 100 milliseconds per line (0.1 seconds). Then you might be able to speed it up by setting a smaller wait or set lines to "Follow" if the commands are running correctly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
Necessary processing-time is not fixed. You may experience that a timing that worked when in Standalone is not enough in a session with multiple stations and NPUs.</div>

<h2>Using Go</h2>

<p>You can use a "Go" instead of a wait time or the "Follow" time. This means that the macro will halt when it reaches a "Go" in the wait column. It will continue running only when receiving a go command.</p>

<p>Go is the default function for an executor key, when the macro is assigned to executors.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Here is a fun example of a macro that turns on or off the sACN output and input. It also re-labels the macro depending on the status<strong> and</strong> it change the frame color.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width:500px">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th scope="col">No.</th>
			<th scope="col">CMD</th>
			<th scope="col">Wait</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Assign Root "DMX_Protocols"."sACN" /OutActive=on /InActive=on</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>
			<p>Appearance Macro "sACN OFF/on" /h=100 /s=100 /br=100</p>
			</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>Label Macro "sACN OFF/on" "sACN ON/off"</td>
			<td>Go</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>
			<p>Assign Root "DMX_Protocols"."sACN" /OutActive=off /InActive=off</p>
			</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>
			<p>Appearance Macro "sACN ON/off" /h=30 /s=100 /br=100</p>
			</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>
			<p>Label Macro "sACN ON/off" "sACN OFF/on"</p>
			</td>
			<td>Follow</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>The macro needs to be labeled "sACN OFF/on" before running it the first time.</p>

<p>Line 1 and 4 are the ones that actually change the settings for sACN output and input.</p>

<p>Line 2 and 5 changes the frame color (appearance).</p>

<p>Line 3 and 6 re-labels the macro.</p>

<p>All line are have a "Follow" in the wait column except line 3. This is the one that separates the "on" and "off" parts, so this is where the macro needs to halt and wait for a new "Go".</p>

<p>If the "<a href="key_keyword_top.html">Top</a>" command is sent to the macro then it will run the macro from the first line.</p>

<p>"<a href="key_keyword_goback.html">GoBack</a>" will execute the previous macro line in a multi line macro. Looking at the example above it will run line 2 if the macro is at line 3 waiting for a Go. If the macro is not active then "GoBack" will run the last macro line.<br />
<br />
Running macros can be paused using the "<a href="key_keyword_pause.html">Pause</a>" command. This only makes sense for timed macros with enough time to actually pause it before it is done.<strong> </strong>You need to do a Go command for the macro to continue.</p>
