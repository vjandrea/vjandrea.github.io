		<h1>Create worlds</h1>
		
		<p>Worlds are created in the programmer, and stored in the World Pool.</p>

<p>Worlds may be thought of as matrix with rows (fixtures) and columns (attributes), and you may eliminate rows and/or columns.</p>

<p>The created world will contain the rows of the current selection, and the columns of any active attribute. If no attributes were active, all columns/attributes will be included in the created world.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select fixture 1 Thru 5 (or any 5 fixtures in your show).</li>
	<li>Press Store followed by an empty world in the <strong>World Pool</strong>.</li>
	<li>Tap the new world.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will now only have programming access to fixture 1 thru 5, which is reflected by the <a href="key_of_fixture_sheet.html">Fixture Sheet Window</a>. You have access to all attributes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worlds do not contain any values, but you need to have active attribute values if you want to have the attribute information or filtering in the world.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Tap world 1 (Full) in the Worlds Pool.</li>
	<li>Select fixture 1 Thru 5 (or any 5 fixtures in your show).</li>
	<li>Give the fixtures a dimmer value - does not matter what value.</li>
	<li>Press Store followed by an empty world in the World Pool.</li>
	<li>Tap the new world.</li>
</ol>

<p>Look in a Fixture Sheet. Here you can see that it is only allowed to select the five fixtures and it is only possible to control the dimmer values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A world is updated simply by restoring the world. If this is done while you are in the world, then you need to select a different world, and then re-select the world you want, before you can see the changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As usual it is really a good idea to name the worlds as soon as they are created.</p>
