		<h1>Working with Layers</h1>
		
		<p>All fixtures are organized in layers.</p>

<p>You can but all your fixtures in one layer or make a layer for each fixtures - it is&nbsp; all up to you.</p>

<p>Usually people makes layers based on fixture types or locations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is all handled from the EditSetup menu.</p>

<p>Press <span class="hardkey">Setup</span> and then tap the <span class="softkey">Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule</span> button.</p>

<p>The menu could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/menu_editsetup_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>EditSetup menu</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The left side of this menu is the Layers. If you tap somewhere in the list then most the buttons below the list are referring to the layers. If you tap inside the list on the right side, then they refer to the fixtures (in the layers).</p>

<h2>Add Layer</h2>

<p>Tapping this button will give you a new (empty) layer. When you make this layer then the console will open the Fixture Wizard (see Adding new fixtures to your show) to help you begin to add fixtures in the new layer. If you do not want to add new fixtures then you can simply close the wizard.</p>

<h2>Delete Layer</h2>

<p>You can delete an entire Layer. This will delete all the fixtures in the layer and <strong>the data will be lost!</strong></p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
You can not oops or undo the deletion of layers or fixtures. Please save your show before deleting layers or fixture.</div>

<h2>Move Layer - Cut and Paste</h2>

<p>You can rearrange your layers. This is done using the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the layer you want to move by tapping it on the screen.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Cut Layer</span> button - this gives the layer a red background color.</li>
	<li>Tap the layer where you want to insert the layer above.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Paste Layer</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>You have now moved your layer to a new location. This does not affect your programming. It does not delete anything and does not add anything.</p>

<h2>Copy Layer - Copy and Paste</h2>

<p>You can copy the structure of a layer. This means that you can copy all the fixtures that are in a layer. This include all information except the ID numbers and the Patch. These numbers are unique and cannot exist twice.</p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
This does not copy your programming! The programming done on the fixtures in the source layer will not be copied with the layer.</div>

<p>This is the steps for copying the layer:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the layer you want to copy by tapping it on the screen.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Copy Layer</span> button.</li>
	<li>Tap the layer where you want to insert the layer above.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Paste Layer</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you have a copy of the layer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Export Layer</h2>

<p>You can export a layer (or even a fixture). This is meant for exporting the information about the structure. This can be used to document the setup and patch.</p>

<p>Please have look at the <a href="key_export_and_import.html">Export and Import</a> topics.</p>

<h2>Move fixtures between layers</h2>

<p>You can move fixtures around in layers or even between different layers. This does not affect anything that might already be programmed with these fixture.</p>

<p>This is the process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the layer with the fixture you want to move.</li>
	<li>Select the fixture.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Cut Fixture</span> button.</li>
	<li>Select the layer where you want to move the fixture to.</li>
	<li>Tap the fixture where you want to insert the fixture above.</li>
	<li>Tap the <span class="softkey">Paste Fixture</span> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are done working with your layers, please leave the <strong>EditSetup</strong> menu.</p>

<p>Now you are asked if you want to save the changes you have made.</p>

<p>Tap <span class="softkey">Yes</span> to save. <span class="softkey">No</span> to not save any changes and keep the fixture schedule as it was. <span class="softkey">Cancel</span> to return to fixture schedule without saving.</p>
