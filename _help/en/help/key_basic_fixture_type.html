		<h1>Different Fixture Types</h1>
		
		<p>The name Fixture Type covers a wide range of different actual fixtures but also elements like Media Servers and virtual elements like Cameras for MA 3D.</p>

<p>It is important that a Fixture Type definition includes information about the correct type. It has influence on how the fixture is handled by the grandMA2 software - especially MA 3D.</p>

<p>It is called <strong>Class</strong> in the Fixture Types Module Manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When grandMA2 handles variable color systems it is called MixColor (see <a href="key_basic_fixture_colormix_mixcolor.html">ColorMix vs. MixColor topic</a> for details). Independent on it being a CMY or LED color system in the fixtures, it is still the same attribute defined in the fixture profile. It is the ColorRGB1 to ColorRGB22 - see the <a href="key_basic_fixture_colormix_mixcolor.html">ColorMix vs. MixColor topic</a> for a list of the ColorRGBs.</p>

<p>The difference in how the grandMA2 interprets the ColorRGBs are in physical range the attributes are given. If the light is added then the physical range is set from 0 to 1. If the attribute subtracts color then the physical range is set from 1 to 0.</p>

<p>The following subtopics explains some of the difference between the types.</p>
