		<h1>Tutorial – Fixture Position Calibration Dialog</h1>
		
		<p>There are two different modes for this dialog: the Absolute and the Free mode.</p>

<p>The Auto Calibration system is a system for the software to position moving light fixtures based on four points of orientation on the floor. Auto Calibration implies a high precision during orientation of the parameters.</p>

<p>Open the Stage View and then open the options of the&nbsp;<strong>Stage View.</strong></p>

<p>How to Calibrate&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mark the 4 physical points of orientation A,B,C and D on your stage. The 4 points have to form a rectangle.</li>
	<li>Enter the physical position of points A to D depending on the mode:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Absolute mode:</strong> Select all fixtures and enter the coordinates of point A (X,Y,Z) and the correct distances to the points B and D – C is automatically calculated.</li>
		<li><strong>Free mode:</strong> Select all fixtures and enter the correct coordinates of point A (X,Y,Z), B (X,Y,Z), C (X,Y,Z) – D is automatically calculated.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Focus each fixture to position A using pan and tilt attributes.</li>
	<li>Select all fixtures again and press <span class="hardkey">Store</span>&nbsp; <span class="softkey">A</span>. The position of the current selection is stored in A.</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for B, C and D.</li>
	<li>Select all fixtures again and tap <span class="softkey">Do Calibration</span>. The physical positions of the fixture selection are calibrated.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fixtures are moved and rotated in the <strong>Stage View</strong>.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
If the fixtures are positioned in an odd manner in the Stage View after the calibration, tap <span class="softkey">Find Alternative Fixture Position</span>.&nbsp;</div>

<p>For more information see&nbsp;<a href="key_patch_autocalibrate.html">Calibration Pop-up</a>.</p>

<div class="tip">It is possible to calibrate each fixture individually within a separate physical rectangle. An asterisk '(*)' means that the physical positions of A,B,C or D differ in the current selection.</div>
