		<h1>Cues and Sequences</h1>
		
		<p>This section is about creating, editing and viewing the cues and sequences. This is some of the primary functions of a lighting console.</p>

<p>The topics here describe all the basic functions and operations regarding cues and sequences. Sequences are closely related to Executors. Taking a look at the <a href="key_exec.html">Executors section</a> might also be a good idea.</p>

<p>The more advanced options and functions for sequences are described in the <a href="key_adv_seq.html">Advanced Sequence Functionality section</a>. For instance this section only describes the most used elements in the Sequence Executor Sheet - the advanced section describes the rest.&nbsp;</p>
