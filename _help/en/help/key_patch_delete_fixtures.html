<p>Deleting a fixture completely removes the fixture and the data associated with the fixture - all programming is lost for the fixture.</p>

<p>If a fixture is unpatched then all data is still there and the fixture can be programmed, but it will not output anything since the system do not know where to send the data.</p>

<p>If fixture ID numbers are removed, then the fixture does not go away and the programming is not lost. It cannot be selected or modified, but the data is still there. If the fixture was stored in groups then these group will get a little red marker. <strong>The DMX data is still going to the output!</strong></p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
It is not possible to Oops or undo the deletion and the data is gone! It is a good idea to save the show before deleting the fixtures.</div>

<h2>Deleting a fixture</h2>
