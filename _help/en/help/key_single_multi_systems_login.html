		<h1>Login on a station</h1>
		
		<p>There are two ways to log into a station.</p>

<p>Before logging in, you will need to know a User name.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Users and the creation of Users and User Profiles, please read the <a href="key_single_multi_systems_create.html">Create User Profiles and Users</a> topic.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
There are two default users in every show file. You can always login as "Guest" with limited access or as Administrator (password: admin) with full access.</div>

<h2>Log in using the GUI</h2>

<p>The main way to login using the GUI is to press the <span class="hardkey">Tools</span> key and the <span class="softkey">Login</span> button. This will open this pop-up on all screens:</p>

<p>A valid user name and (if there is a) password needs to be typed in.</p>

<p>One other option is when in the User &amp; Profile Setup (follow link above) then you can select a User and tap the <span class="softkey">Login</span> button in the lover right corner.</p>

<h2>Log in using the command line</h2>

<p>Login can also be done using the <a href="key_keyword_login.html">Login</a> command. Follow the link to read the details about it.</p>

<p>The general use is that "Login" is typed followed by the user name and the password (if any) and then executes the command with Please/Enter.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>If you wanted to log in as administrator then you would type:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; login administrator admin</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
