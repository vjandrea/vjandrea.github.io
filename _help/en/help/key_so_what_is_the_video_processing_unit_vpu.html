		<h1>What is the MA Video Processing Unit (VPU)?</h1>
		
		<p>The <strong>MA Video Processing Unit (VPU)</strong> is a Media Server that was designed to be fully integrated into the MA system.</p>

<p>The MA VPU comes in three sizes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>MA VPU plus</li>
	<li>MA VPU basic</li>
	<li>MA VPU light</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a second generation of the plus and basic called MK2.</p>

<p>The MA VPUs are media servers capable of handling a 3D environment.</p>

<p>It has all the normal features for media servers. Effects, Soft edge, Pixel mapping, Warping, and so on.</p>

<p>One of the big advantages of the MA VPU is the option to use the pixel mapper internally. This means that fixtures can be positioned in a 3D environment in the console and then the MA VPU software can be used to run complex video content, mapped to the fixtures.</p>

<p>The MA VPU is a feature-rich software and hardware and it got its <a href="http://help.malighting.com/view/?map=map/Map_FullContent_Video.xml">own manual</a>.</p>
