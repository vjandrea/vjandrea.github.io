		<h1>Change IP address of the MA Network Switch</h1>
		
		<p>You can change the IP address of the MA Network Switch from a connected grandMA2 console or a connected grandMA2 onPC.<br />
The IP address will be used to reach the web interface and to reach the connected grandMA2 console or the connected grandMA2 onPC.<br />
The current IP address is displayed in the IP ETHERCON 1(ETH0) or in the IP ETHERCON 1(ETH0.1) column, depending on the used Ethernet connector.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
If you change the IP address and the new IP address is within another subnet, it is necessary to set the IP address on your computer or grandMA2 console to connect to the web interface. For more information about how to change the IP address see <a href="key_network.html">Networking</a>.<br />
If the computer or the grandMA2 console and the switch are in different subnet, the connection is not possible.</div>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
Make sure that every device in the network has its unique IP address. If two devices have the same IP address in a network the devices might not be reachable.</div>
