		<h1>Media Server</h1>
		
		<p><strong>Media Servers</strong> are a fixture type that could be characterized as virtual fixtures, but it is software being controlled often on dedicated hardware.</p>

<p>Media servers can take up an massive amount of attributes. Some media servers use several DMX universes. It is also in media servers that attributes using 3 DMX channel appear (24-bit control).</p>

<p>Every media server is different. Some are flexible with their configuration, others have a fixed set of attributes.</p>

<p>Most are configured around a set of (video) layers, that needs to be patched. Some have master layers and even camera layers.</p>

<p>Other elements in media servers could be pixel mappers, 3D mapping/warping, sound, effects, particle systems, and so on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can be very complex to create good fixture profiles for media servers.</p>

<p>Selecting the <strong>Media Server</strong> fixture type does not necessary assign a class to the fixture profile. Since the server is not visualized as a fixture in MA 3D, then this OK. The video output from the server might be used as a CITP stream into the MA 3D (read more about CITP in the <a href="key_network_citp.html">Using CITP topics</a>).&nbsp;</p>
