		<h1>Organize The Show with Multiple Timecode Shows</h1>
		
		<p>This topic has a few tips and tricks when the show contains multiple timecode shows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Separate into songs or sections</h2>

<p>Multiple timecode shows implies this. It is a good idea to separate the performance into smaller sections. If it is for a concert, then it is an obvious choice to make a timecode show for each song. If it is a theatrical or musical performance, then it might be more tricky but there is often obvious time to make separations.</p>

<p>For music it might also be a good idea to put each song on separate pages.</p>

<p>For an overview it can be a good idea to create a view with the timecode pool displaying all the recorded timecode shows. This makes it easy to see the play mode of the timecode show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Offset the start time</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to agree with the ones supplying the time source signal that each section or song starts at a different time instead of all of them starting at time 0 (zero).</p>

<p>This can help void running the wrong tracks at the wrong time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Use Link Selected</h2>

<p>If the time source is external, then it might be a good idea to set all the timecode shows to <strong>Link Selected</strong>. That makes it very easy to <strong>Turn Off</strong> the external source if changes are needed or if there are rehearsals where the timecode starts and stop at different times without the need for the light to follow. Simply tap the relevant slot in the timecode slot pool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Consider not recording the Master intensity</h2>

<p>Depending on the situation it might be an idea to not have the intensity <strong>Masters</strong> track stored in the timecode show.</p>

<p>If it is stored in the timecode show, then it is "locked" to the recorded position as long a the track is running. If it is not in the timecode show then it is possibly to adjust the master level while the tracks are running.</p>

<p>But this is a matter of preferences. Other likes to have the master track stored, so they know that it is up and they do not forget to bring up the master.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Macros can be a big help</h2>

<p>Macros can be a big help in shows with multiple timecode shows.</p>

<p>It could be macros that selects the correct timecode show, changes the page, and maybe even set the play mode for the selected timecode show.</p>

<p>Macros that changes the play mode for the selected timecode show is very useful, just as macros that turns off all timecode shows can be really good.</p>

<p>It can also be macros that selects the timecode slot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was some inspiration or thoughts that might help you organizing a show with multiple timecode shows.</p>
