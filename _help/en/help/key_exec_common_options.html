		<h1>Common executor options</h1>
		
		<p>The executors most common options, and their associated options, are explained in this topic. The rest are explained in the <a href="key_adv_exec_options.html">Executor Options topic</a>.</p>

<p>There are many options available for executors - especially sequences assigned to executors. They are accessed using the Assign Menu. One way to open the menu is to press the Assign key followed by a key associated with the executor you want to change.</p>

<p>On the right side of the menu there are a button called Options. Tapping this opens the options part of the Assign Menu. This is what it looks like with a sequence assigned to the executor:</p>

<p>The options look different depending on what is assigned to the executor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Auto Start and Auto Stop</h2>

<p>The <strong>Auto Start</strong> feature switches the executor 'On' when master is moved above zero.</p>

<p>The <strong>Auto Stop</strong> feature switches the executor 'Off' when master is moved down to zero.</p>

<p>There are some other options that are relevant for Auto Start and Auto Stop:</p>

<h3><a id="off_time" name="off_time"></a>Auto Stop Off Time</h3>

<p>If Auto Stop is active, then this option is visible. When <strong>Auto Stop Off Time</strong> is active, then performing the auto stop will use the Off time for the Executor.</p>

<h3>Master Go</h3>

<p>The <strong>MasterGo</strong> function is active if Auto Stop is turned Off. Tapping this button will open the Select Master Go pop-up. It looks like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-master-go_v3-3.png" />

</figure>

<p>There are four options here. They all take effect when the master fader is moved from zero and up. The options are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>No Master Go</strong>:<br />
	The cue is still running.</li>
	<li><strong>Master Go</strong>:<br />
	It executes a Go.</li>
	<li><strong>Master On</strong>:<br />
	The current cue is reloaded (fading in again).</li>
	<li><strong>Master Top</strong>:<br />
	The first cue is activated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Restart</h3>

<p>Restart is used when the executor has been Off and is turned On again.</p>

<p>Tapping the button will open the small Select Restart Mode pop-up. It looks like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_select-restart-mode_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Small Select Restart Mode pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are three options here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>First Cue</strong>:<br />
	This always restarts the sequence with the first cue.</li>
	<li><strong>Current Cue</strong>:<br />
	This restarts the sequence with the cue where it was when the sequence was turned Off.</li>
	<li><strong>Next Cue</strong>:<br />
	This restarts the sequence with the next cue based on where it was when the executor was turned Off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Priority</h2>

<p>The priorities are one of the common options to change. The description of the priorities are found in the <a href="key_cs_playback.html#priority">Playing Back Cues topic</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tracking</h2>

<p>Explanations about tracking and how to turn it On or Off is found in the <a href="key_cs_what_is_tracking.html">What is Tracking topic</a>. Here are also the explanations about <strong>Release Firststep</strong> and <strong>Wrap Around</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="on_off_overwritten" name="on_off_overwritten"></a>Off On Overwritten</h2>

<p>The <strong>Off On Overwritten</strong> function will allow that an executor is turned Off if another executor has taken control with all the attributes = this executor has no longer control of any attributes.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>There are two sequences. Sequence one have values for fixture 1 at 100% and using a red color. Sequence two has the same fixture also at 100% and in a blue color.</p>

<p>Both sequences are assigned to executors with Off On Overwritten, AutoStart, and AutoStop active.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Moving up the fader on the first executor will turn the fixture to 100% and in a red color.</li>
	<li>Fading in the second executor will make the fixture turn blue.<br />
	When the second fader is completely faded in (at the top), then it has control of all the attributes stored in the first sequence.</li>
	<li>The first executor is then turned Off by <strong>Off On Overwritten</strong>.</li>
	<li>Taking the second fader down will make the fixture fade out.</li>
</ol>

<p>If <strong>Off On Overwritten</strong> is <em>not</em> active then the same scenario would be:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Moving up the fader for the first executor will turn the fixture On in a red color.</li>
	<li>Moving up the second fader will make the fixture turn blue.</li>
	<li>Moving down the second fader will make the fixture red (when the fader is at 0) because the first executor is still active.</li>
</ol>
