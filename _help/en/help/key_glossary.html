<p><strong>MA-Net2</strong>:<br />
Integral part of the MA System architecture. All MA series 2 devices are connected via the MA-Net2 as if they were one device. All of these components contain all system data that is needed to control the processes and to synchronize the outputs in real-time. To use MA-Net2 see <a href="key_network_dmx_protocols.html">Network Protocols</a>. To assign MA-Net2 Presets on ports for the MA Network Switch see <a href="key_control_ma_switch_presets.html">Control the MA Network Switch - Edit Presets</a>.</p>

The master rate multiplies all timings by a factor.<br />
The factors from the master rate goes from Stop (= no further output) via 1:1 (=stored timings) up to 256 (=multiplies the timing by 256).<br />
The master rate is a dynamic fader that means, if that fader has the position of 50 % the rate fader has the factor 1:1. From 1:1 the fader goes dynamic up to 256 that equates a fader position from 100 %. It is the same from 1:1 down to Stop.</p>

<p><strong>Master Speed:</strong><br />
Controls the speed of effects and the playback speed of chasers.</p>

<p><strong>Mbps</strong> (Megabit per second):<br />
Unit of data transfer rate. The data transfer rate of the etherCON ports is 10/100/1000 Mbps.</p>

<p><strong>Presets:</strong><br />
There are nine preset types to control from the console. Refer to, Preset Pool View and Preset Type Bar.</p>

<p><strong>Priority:</strong><br />
Some values have a higher priority than others. In other words, they will not be overwritten by those with a lower priority. The programmer, for instance, has a higher priority than an executor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Programmer:</strong><br />
Is a container with the current selection of fixtures and values of manual adjusted attributes. Programmer values are red values. For more information about the colors see <a href="key_ws_colors.html">Workspace – Colors</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Program Time Master:</strong><br />
The program time master controls the fade times of all program values and effects between the 0 and 10 seconds. Adjust time in <strong>Setup – User – Settings – Max. Program Time</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
This affects both, the adding of new values into the programmer, and the removing of values from the programmer with the <span class="hardkey">Clear</span> key.<br />
The program time master can be a fader. Refer to, Empty Executor Window.</p>

<h2>R</h2>

<p><strong>RDM</strong> (= Remote Device Management Protocol):<br />

Is a timecode to synchronize different devices from different manufacturers in the audio and video technology.</p>

<p><strong>Snap:</strong><br />
A lot of fixture types with gobo and color wheels have snap channels.<br />
That means those attributes will be directly executed disregarding the cue fade time.</p>

<p><strong>Snap Percent:</strong><br />
Is a setting after how much percent of the fade time the attribute will be executed.<br />
The default value for snap channels is 0 %.</p>

<p><strong>Spanning Tree</strong>:<br />
