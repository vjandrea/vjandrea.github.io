		<h1>Arrangement of Objects (Align Objects)</h1>
		
		<p>MA 3D allows automatic arrangement of 3D objects. Therefore select the objects to arrange via 'Ctrl + mouse click’ or multiple selections in the assets tree. Via the menu entry 'Functions - Arrangement’ the Arrangement Window opens:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_3d/3d_arrangementwindow_1.png" /></p>
			</td>
			<td>Objects can be arranged in several ways like:- Moved along the X,Y,Z axis- Moved along a circle line in X,Y,Z space- Arrange in a 2D matrix Corresponding to the grandMA2 console alignment function objects can be arranged in relation to the origin object like:- &lt;, &gt;, &gt;&lt;, and &lt;&gt;If the 'Relative’ flag is set every push of the 'Apply’ button increments the arrangement by the given value. Note: The origin is 0,0,0 if the 'Relative’ flag is off. Otherwise it is the own position.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_3d/3d_abc_at_000_1.png" /></td>
			<td>Example: Several objects inserted into the Stage View at the origin (0,0,0).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_3d/3d_abc_at_aligned_1.png" /></td>
			<td>Objects aligned via 'Move’ and 'Align &lt;’ function along the X-axis.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><img alt="" src="../../../img/ma_3d/3d_abcd_alignedinmatrix_1.png" /></p>
			</td>
			<td>Objects aligned as a matrix via 'Matrix (2D)’ function.</td>
