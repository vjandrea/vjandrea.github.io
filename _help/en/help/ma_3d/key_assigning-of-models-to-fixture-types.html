<p>At best the fixture type of a device is left in the data base. If the very same type is found by MA 3D (ModelKey == Model.ModelKey) it will be used without any validation. In this case a fixture type always will be assigned to the same model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If no model key is found the application searches for a more suitable model, like same 'DeviceManufacturer’ , 'DeviceName’ etc..</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
The fields 'DeviceManufacturer’ and 'DeviceName’ can be placeholders to find the right model for variant spellings. For example: 'Vari*Lite' is often spelled as ‚Vari-Lite', or a ‚VL1000 AS’ should use the same model as 'VL1000 AI’. In this case both fields should contain a ‚Vari?Lite’ and 'VL1000*’.</div>

<p>Possible placeholders:&nbsp;</p>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>*&nbsp;</th>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>0-n any characters&nbsp;</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>+&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>1-n any characters&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>?&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>0-1 any characters&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>

			<td>#&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>

			<td>1 arbitrary character&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Often there are several variants of fixture types in a model range. So the attachment of a '*’ is recommended - for example: 'VL1000*’. The spelling is not case sensitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a special 3D object shall be used for a model even though a model with the notation exists the 'ModelPriority’ can be increased (in steps of 100). For example a 'VL1000AS’ with the priority of 100 would be preferred instead of 'VL1000*’ with a standard priority of 0.</p>

<p>MA 3D is delivered with standard models for every 'DeviceClass’ type. The standard model has the following setting: DeviceManufacturer = ’*’, DeviceName = '*’ and ModelPriority = -100000. These models have a low priority and are used only if no other model with higher priority is found.</p>
