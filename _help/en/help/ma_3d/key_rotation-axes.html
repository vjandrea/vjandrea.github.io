		<h1>Rotation Axes</h1>
		
		<p>Rotation axes are marked with a square (consisting of two triangles). The name of this object must contain the appropriate parameter for the desired axis (e.g. _XAT)&nbsp;<a href="key_parameters.html">see Parameter.</a></p>

<p>All normals of this object have to point in the same direction.</p>

<p>During its import the object is converted into an axis. It is aligned along the direction of the normals (vertical on the square) positioned in the center of the square.</p>

<p>In case of movement the right-hand rule can be applied: Thumb shows into direction of normals, objects rotate into the direction of the fingers (with positive values).</p>

<p>The image shows the tilt axis of a moving head fixture. The normals of the square show to the left. The lens moves away from the viewer if the tilt axis is driven with values greater than 0Â°.</p>
