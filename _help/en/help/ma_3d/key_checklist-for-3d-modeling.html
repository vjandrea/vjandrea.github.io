		<h1>Checklist for 3D Modeling</h1>
		
		<p>Go through this checklist if you created a 3D model:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are the settings of the sunshade type in all objects correct?<br />
	For example, were the calculations of shadow excluded in your own source of light of the fixture body, clamp and head?</li>
	<li>Do the names of objects have more than 8 characters (max. 8 characters)?</li>
	<li>Are the names of objects unique?</li>
	<li>Are objects made up of triangles only?</li>
	<li>Has information got lost during export? To check if the information got lost, open the exported file using the modeling tool.</li>
</ul>
