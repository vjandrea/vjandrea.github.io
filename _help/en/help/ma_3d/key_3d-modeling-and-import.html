		<h1>3D Modeling and Import</h1>
		
		<p>MA 3D is created for the visualization of three-dimensional stage layouts to be utilized together with lighting control desks of MA. It comes with a library of common types of light fixtures e.g., par cans, moving mirror, moving heads and LED fixtures.</p>

<p>With this large number of different fixtures, it is not possible to cover all models. MA 3D offers the opportunity to import 3D models created via a 3D CAD program. Most of the 3D CAD programs offer the export into the .3ds format.</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint</strong>:<br />
This tutorial requires the knowledge of handling a 3D construction program.</div>

<p>3D models are created with 3D design programs such as ‘Cinema 4D’, 3Ds Max, etc. After creation, the model is imported in .3ds format via the MA 3D import function. The import tool can be found using the menu entry: ‘File – Import – Import 3D Model…’. Single files as well as complete directories can be imported.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply parameters to objects inside a 3D model. These parameters influence the behavior of the object within MA 3D.<br />
The parameters are defined using the name of the object. They are organized in a hierarchic order.<br />
A parameter block begins with '_X'. The sub-parameter follows without separators, e.g., 'Test_XAP' identifies the object as an axis of the pan movement.<br />

<p>The imported model can be viewed in the ‘Model Test Area’ window that can be operated similarly to the 3D ‘Stage View’.<br />
Properties such as ‘Name’, ‘Category’, etc. can also be edited. After the editing, the model can be stored in the media database and is ready to be used in MA 3D.</p>
