		<h1>Create a Session</h1>
		
		<p>Creating, joining a MA session, or inviting session members is an exclusive grandMA2 console or grandMA2 onPC feature.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong>&nbsp;Hardware connection between a grandMA2 console and a computer, or a grandMA2 onPC and a MA 3D.</p>

<p>Sessions can be created from grandMA2 console/onPC only, refer to&nbsp;<a href="../key_network.html">MA Network Configuration - 3D</a>.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Information:</strong><br />
The software version of the MA 3D and the console/onPC needs to be the same.<br />
MA 3D v.<strong>3.0.0</strong>.5 fits to grandMA2 console or onPC version&nbsp;<strong>3.0.0</strong>.<br />
Important are the first 3 numbers. If you have different version numbers, there is no connection possible. Download the latest software version at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.malighting.com/en/support-downloads/software.html">www.malighting.com</a>.</div>

<div class="important"><strong>Information:</strong><br />
