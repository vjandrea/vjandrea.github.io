		<h1>Control the MA NDPs</h1>
		
		<p>MA Lighting's dimMA dimming system is used in the&nbsp;grandMA1&nbsp;series. It can be mixed within an installation as it has the same dimming curves and rise times. All dimmers can be controlled by any DMX source. The MA NDP (Network Dimmer Processor) sends and receives different Ethernet protocols as well as&nbsp;DMX.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the grandMA console or any other control system is switched off, the MA NDP&nbsp;takes over the control and starts operating as the “heart” of the entire network. This functionality provides a detailed overview and control of the entire system. The settings can be centrally organized while the entire control of all parts of the network remains.</p>
