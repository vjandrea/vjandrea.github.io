		<h1>What are Attributes, Features &amp; Preset Types</h1>
		
		<p>These are the building blocks and structure behind the fixtures.</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are what is actually controlled. Attributes are organized into features. For instance both the Attribute for selecting a Gobo on GoboWheel 1 and the Attribute that rotates the selected Gobo are in the same Gobo1 <strong>Feature</strong>. Features are organized in <strong>Preset Types</strong>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The best way to understand the structure is to look at the Encoder Bar - This is explained in details in the <a href="key_ws_encoder_bar.html">Encoder Bar topic</a>.</p>

<p>In short: The top row here is the <strong>Preset Types</strong>. The button on the left side in the middle row is the <strong>Feature</strong> swipe button. This can be used to toggle through the Features of the selected Preset Type.</p>

<p>The bottom row is the <strong>Attributes</strong> in the selected Feature. Sometimes there are more than four Attributes in a Feature. Then the Feature will have pages named alphabetically on the Feature button.</p>

<p>If we look at the Preset Type Color, then it can have several Features, including color wheels and a MixColor system. The MixColor Feature can have several Attributes, including Red, Green, Blue, and White.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every fixture has a minimum of one attribute, but possibly multiple attributes to be controlled.</p>

<p>A generic dimmer typically has only one attribute - <strong>Dimmer</strong>, while an advanced moving light may have 30+ different attributes.</p>

<p>grandMA2 counts in Attributes and not in DMX channel - read more about that in the <a href="key_so_paramters_vs_dmx_channels.html">Parameters vs. DMX channels topic</a>.</p>
