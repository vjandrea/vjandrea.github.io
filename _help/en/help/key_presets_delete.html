		<h1>Delete Presets</h1>
		
		<p>It is possible to delete presets in three different ways. Use either the keys of the console or the command line.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>To delete single presets:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Press <span class="hardkey">Del</span> and then tap the preset you would like to delete.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li>To delete several presets, type into the command line:</li>
</ol>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Delete Preset 4.1 Thru 4.5</div>

<p>Deletes presets 1 to 5 in the preset pool <strong>Color</strong>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li>To delete all presets in all pools, type into the command line:</li>
</ol>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Delete Preset *.*</div>

<p>Empties all pools completely.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
If you store a preset in a sequence and then delete the preset, the link to the preset pool will be removed from the sequence. Instead, the actual values will be displayed in the sequence. Oopsing the action will recover the preset but not the link.&nbsp;</div>
