		<h1>What are the MA nodes?</h1>
		
		<p>The nodes from MA Lighting work as a translator between the network data and the DMX.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A node is connected to the network and it listens to the DMX data in the network. It is configured to handle some specific DMX universes.</p>

<p>It can be used to output a DMX universe. It will listen to the DMX data stream on the network and translate that information into a DMX512-A signal.</p>

<p>A node can also input a DMX signal into the network. Then it receives a DMX signal and translates it into a network data stream.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When nodes are used in a MA-Net2 system, then the advantage is that the DMX ports can be configured from the system and the DMX output is synchronized in the entire network.</p>

<p>Nodes can also work with other network protocols. They can run in Art-Net and sACN. Configuration is still done via the grandMA2 software (for example a computer running the grandMA2 onPC software) or from a browser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The older MA nodes from grandMA1 can also run in MA-Net1 mode. Then they can talk with the grandMA1 systems.</p>

<p>The older NSPs can be used as a MA 4Port Node in a grandMA2 system.</p>

<p>The older NSPs and nodes from grandMA1 only have a 100Mbit/s network card. The new nodes use a Gigabit network adaptor.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that the grandMA1 devices will continue to work with MA-Net2 in the future. They will however always be able to run Art-Net and sACN.</p>
