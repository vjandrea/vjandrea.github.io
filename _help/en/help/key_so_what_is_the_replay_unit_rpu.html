		<h1>What is the Replay Unit (RPU)</h1>
		
		<p>A <strong>grandMA2 replay unit (RPU)</strong> is considered as a console in the system.</p>

<p>It has the same software and capabilities as the consoles. It is a 19" 3 Unit rack mount version of the console, without all the user interface and physical controls. It got the same connectors on the back panel as a console (it got less USB connectors).</p>

<p>It functions exactly like a console in the system.</p>
