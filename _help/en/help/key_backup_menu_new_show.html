		<h1>Create a new show</h1>
		
		<p>Several tabs in the backup menu offers the option to start a new show. It is not possible in the read only tabs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The New Show pop-up</h2>

<p>Pressing the new show button in the backup menu opens a pop-up that could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_new-show_v3-2.png" />
<figcaption><em>New Show pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this pop-up it can be chosen what show information from the currently loaded show will be cleared or removed.</p>

<p>In the top it is possible to write the name for the new show.</p>

<p>Pressing the&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../../img/icon_cross_v3-2.png" />&nbsp;opens an on-screen keyboard.</p>

<p>Below the name there are different boxes that can be selected. This is the different parts of the show file.</p>

<p>The idea is that when a new show is started there is the option to keep some of the existing data from the currently loaded show.</p>

<h3>Clear Show Data</h3>

<p>This is activated as a default. The show data is the patch and fixture schedule, stored sequences, presets, groups, effects, and so on. Basically everything that is in a pool somewhere and the imported 3D elements.</p>

<h3>Clear Time Config</h3>

<p>The time configuration is the current time, location, daylight savings settings and NTP&nbsp;(Network Time Protocol) setup. If this is cleared then the console will reset the location to the default location (The parking lot outside&nbsp;McFIT&nbsp;Fitnessstudio in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany) and take the time from the computer Bios.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Clear Global Settings</h3>

<p>The global settings are the ones found in Setup -&gt; Console -&gt; Global Settings. The settings here are shared in the session and includes enabling and disabling the Remote and Telnet, RDM, WYSIWYG, and so on.</p>

<h3>Clear Local Settings</h3>

<p>The local settings are the ones found in Setup -&gt; Console -&gt; Local Settings. These settings only affects the local console and not all consoles in a session. It includes settings like the console language and LED background light settings.</p>

<h3>Clear Network Protocols</h3>

<p>Network protocols are the settings for outputting DMX via an Ethernet connection. It includes ArtNet, sACN, ETC-Net2, KiNet1, Pathport and Shownet. These settings are found in Setup -&gt; Network -&gt; Network Protocols.</p>

<h3>Clear Network Config</h3>

<p>Network configuration is the settings for what devices should be in the session and the DMX port setup.</p>

<h3>Clear User Profiles</h3>

<p>User profiles keep all the data that is connected to the users. Clearing this data leaves only the Administrator and Guest users and the Default user profile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a <span class="softkey">Clear All</span> button that selects all the above boxes.</p>

<p>When the desired selection is made, then tap the <span class="softkey">Please</span> button in the pop-up.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New show using the command line</h2>

<p>It is possible to create a new show using the command line. The command is called <span class="syntax">NewShow</span>. Read more about it <a href="key_keyword_newshow.html">here</a>.</p>
