		<h1>Wheel Manager</h1>
		
		<p>If you have arrived at this topic from a link without reading the previous topic, then please read <a href="key_adv_fixture_anatomy.html">Anatomy of a Fixture Type</a> first.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wheel Manager</strong> lists the different wheels for the fixture. It can be color wheels, gobo wheels, but also scrollers are defined as a wheel.</p>

<p>The wheel manager could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/menu_fixture-editor_wheel-manager_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Wheel manager</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are some buttons at the bottom that add or delete rows in the manager. The <span class="softkey">Diagnostic</span> button will open a pop-up that list the errors and warnings for the selected row.</p>

<p>The <span class="softkey">Edit Row</span> button will open an editor where the selected wheel can be defined. Read more <a href="#edit_wheel">below</a>.</p>

<p>Each row is a wheel. The wheels needs to be connected to a subattribute. This is also the only column that can be edited. The <strong>No.</strong> column auto generates a number for the row. The <strong>Name</strong> columns auto generates a name based in the selected subattribute. Editing the <strong>SubAttrib</strong> column opens the Select Subattribute pop-up. It lists all the defined subattributes.</p>

<h2><a id="edit_wheel" name="edit_wheel"></a>Editing wheels</h2>

<p>The wheels contain slots. These slots contain a color or a gobo. The editor could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/img_edit-fixture_wheel-manager_edit-row_v3-3.png" />

</figure>

<p>There are two buttons at the bottom that adds or delete rows or slots in the wheel.</p>

<p>This is a short description of the columns in the editor:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>No.</strong>:<br />
	This is an auto generated number for the row. It cannot be edited. It is this number that is reference when editing the <a href="key_adv_fixture_anatomy.html#edit_channelsets">Channel Sets</a> as the <strong>Slot</strong> number.</li>
	<li><strong>Media Name</strong>:<br />
	A name can be added to the row. This name is not used anywhere else.</li>
	<li><strong>Media Filename</strong>:<br />
	This cell can be edited if a gobo image needs to be added. Editing this cell opens the <strong>Open File pop-up</strong> browser. It can be used to browse trough the folders and select an image. If a color is selected in the Color column, then a color image is auto generated.</li>
	<li><strong>Color</strong>:<br />
	This cell can be edited to add a color to the slot. Editing this cell opens the <strong>Select Color pop-up</strong> where a color can be selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Close the editor when the wheel is correct.</p>
