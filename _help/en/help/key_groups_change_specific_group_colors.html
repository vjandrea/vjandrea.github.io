		<h1>Change colors in group options for all in order and all out of order</h1>
		
		<p>The following describes how to set colors in All in Order and All out of Order in Group Options.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="softkey">All in Order</span>&nbsp;shows that the fixtures are selected in the same order they were initially stored in the corresponding group.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span class="softkey">All Out of Order</span> shows that the fixtures are selected in a different order they were initially stored in the corresponding group.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;To change the group colors in <span class="softkey">All in Order</span> and <span class="softkey">All Out of Order</span>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>pool Groups.<br />
	- Tap on an empty space on the screen.&nbsp;Create Basic Window&nbsp;opens.<br />
	- Tap <span class="softkey">Pools</span>, then tap <span class="softkey">Groups</span>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tap the <strong>yellow ball</strong>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="../../img/icon_yellow-ball_3_2.png" />&nbsp;in the upper left corner of the Group Pool Window.&nbsp;<br />
	Group Options opens.&nbsp;<br />

	<em>Group Options</em><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Tap&nbsp;<span class="softkey">All In Order</span>&nbsp;and then choose a color from the&nbsp;<strong>color table</strong>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<strong>color circle.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	- The color you have chosen is displayed as a line within the pool object right above the font of the pool object.</li>
	<li>Tap&nbsp;<span class="softkey">All Out of Order</span>&nbsp;and then choose a color from the <strong>color table</strong> or the <strong>color circle.</strong><br />
	- The color you have chosen is displayed as a line within the pool object right above the font of the pool object.</li>
</ol>

<p>LetÂ´s say we have selected the color green in <span class="softkey">All in Order</span> and the color yellow in <span class="softkey">All Out of Order</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what it would look like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more information on how to reset and adjust colors, change the pool into sheet style and/or how to use the&nbsp;<strong>Hue</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Saturation&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>Brightness&nbsp;</strong>slider see&nbsp;<a href="key_pools_options.html">Adjust pool options</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
Some fixtures may have a red line within the pool object right above the font of the pool object. This red line is automatically generated when all fixtures or a part of fixtures are not available due to storing onto another <a href="key_keyword_world.html">world</a>. &nbsp;</div>

<p>The pool options are now adjusted to your needs and are saved in your user profile.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:<strong> </strong></strong><br />
You can also use the <a href="key_keyword_appearance.html">Appearance keyword</a>&nbsp;to change the color of one or more pool objects.</div>
