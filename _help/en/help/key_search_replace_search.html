		<h1>Search</h1>
		
		<p>Search can be used to find almost anything in a show file.</p>

<p>The general idea behind search is that an object is searched - maybe with a limited scope - the result is displayed and the result can be used as a basis for further action.</p>

<p>The result can be viewed in a report that can be used as a world or saved in text file. The result is stored in a (hidden) world called SearchResult. This can be used to limit the search even more.</p>

<p>The syntax is:</p>

<p><span class="syntax"><strong>Search [</strong>search for objects] ( <strong>At</strong>&nbsp;[search values] )&nbsp;<strong>If [</strong>search in objects]</span></p>

<p>The <a href="key_keyword_search.html">Search keyword</a> has a description of how it is used and some nice examples. The Search command can be reached by pressing and holding the <span class="hardkey"><img alt="ma" src="../../img/ma_1.png" /></span> key while pressing the <span class="hardkey">Move</span> key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Searching for values</h2>

<p>Searching where values are used is very easy.</p>

<p>For instance a search for the dimmer value of 100 can be done like this:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Search Value 100</div>

<p>The result will be a listing of all the locations the dimmer value 100 is used (including the programmer).</p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
If the attribute is not specified, it will be searched for the dimmer attribute.</div>

<p>The result of the search appears in a <strong>Search pop-up</strong> like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_search-value_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Search pop-up - value 100</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the image above the search resulted in 7 results.</p>

<p>The title bar of the <strong>Search </strong>pop-up has some special buttons - besides the two standard <strong>move the pop-up</strong> and <strong>close the pop-up</strong> buttons. The following is a short description of the special buttons:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Selfix Search Result</strong>:<br />
	This will take any fixtures represented in the search result as a selection.</li>
	<li><strong>World Search Result</strong>:<br />
	This will create a hidden world with the fixtures and attributes in the search result. This world can also be accessed using the <a href="key_keyword_searchresult.html">SearchResult command.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Save</strong>:<br />
	Tapping this button will open the browser pop-up that allows you to select a location to save a text file (txt) with the result.</li>
	<li><strong>Load</strong>:<br />
	This function is not implemented.</li>
	<li><strong>Ok</strong>:<br />
	Tapping this button is the same as closing the pop-up.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A search can be limited to only search in a specific range of objects.</p>

<p>For instance searching for a Zoom value of 40 in the All Presets (preset pool number 0):</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Search Attribute "Zoom" At 40 If Preset 0."*"</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Searching for objects</h2>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
Searching for presets or effects is an OBJECT Search - not a value search!</div>

<p>Nearly any kind of object can be searched.</p>

<p>Use the following command to see where dimmer preset number 2 is used:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Search Preset 1.2</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also possible to limit the search inside a different object.</p>

<p>For instance searching for the preset only in sequence number 6:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Search Preset 1.2 If Sequence 6</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fixtures can be searched. For instance searching fixture 1 through 10:</p>

<div class="cl_input">[Channel]&gt; Search Fixture 1 Thru 10</div>

<p>This search could give the following result:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_search-fixture_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Search pop-up - fixture 1 through 10</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here we can see where the ten objects (the fixtures) are used.</p>
