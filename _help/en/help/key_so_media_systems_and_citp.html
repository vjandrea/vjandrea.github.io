		<h1>Media systems and CITP</h1>
		
		<h2>Media Systems - Media Servers / Players</h2>

<p>A media server can be many things.</p>

<p>It can be a simple DMX controlled box that can display video and maybe still images. It can also be a big expensive system with multiple synchronized outputs and everything in between and beyond. There is no universal solution that fits all and makes everyone happy.</p>

<p>MA VPUs are made to be controlled and programmed from the grandMA2 system.</p>

<p>Media servers from other manufactures can be integrated into the MA system. They can be controlled via direct DMX, Art-Net, sACN or other network protocols. Some are even capable of listening to DMX information in MA-Net2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>CITP</h2>

<p>The CITP protocol suite allows to exchange images, stream videos and configure fixture information.</p>

<p>If a 3rd party media system supports the full CITP protocol, then thumbnails can be exchanged for each of the video/image files on the media device. It is also possible to watch a video stream from the media device on a console and on a surface in MA 3D.</p>

<p>For more about getting thumbnails via CITP have a look at the <a href="key_network_citp.html">CITP connection</a> topic.</p>

<p>Have a look at the description of the <a href="key_network_citp_stream.html">CITP viewer</a> to learn more about watching a CITP video stream on the console.</p>

<p>Some visualizers can also display the CITP video stream from media systems.</p>
