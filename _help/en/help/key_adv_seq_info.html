		<h1>Sequence info window</h1>
		
		<p>Cues can have an info text. This text can be multi line.</p>

<p>The first line can be visible in the Sequence Executor Sheet, but the next lines cannot be seen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sequence Info window displays all the cue info text in one window in an easy to read overview.</p>

<p>The window can be created using the <a href="key_windows.html">Create Basic Windows pop-up</a> and is found in the "Other" tab.</p>

<p>It could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/window_sequence-info_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Sequence Info window</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The title bar shows the number of the executor and the sequence name and number, of the currently displayed info. Each line of information has a yellow ball next the info text.</p>

<p>The title bar also has four buttons that changes the main part of the window.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Link</strong>:<br />
	This swipe button offers two options. <strong>Link Last Go</strong> or <strong>Link Selected</strong>. This determine what sequences info the window displays.</li>
	<li><strong>Auto Scroll</strong>:<br />
	The active cue will have a yellow cue number and name - other cues have a green text color. In long sequences it might be nice to activate Auto Scroll. Then the window will automatically scroll the list so the active cue is always visible.</li>
	<li><strong>Show Empty</strong>:<br />
	This allows the option to show or hide cues, in the list, that does not have any information.</li>
	<li><strong>Edit</strong>:<br />
	When <strong>Edit</strong> is active, then all cues got a small yellow ball. Tapping the small white dot next the yellow ball will open the <strong>Edit Info pop-up</strong> - see more about editing cue info below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Opening the Options for this window give the option to change the font size of the Info window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a id="edit_info" name="edit_info"></a>Editing the Cue info</h2>

<p>The cue information can be edited by editing the Info cell in the <a href="key_cs_cue_sequence.html">Sequence Executor Sheet</a> or Edit Mode can be activated in this Sequence Info Window.</p>

<p>Editing the info will open the Edit Info pop-up. It could look like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_edit-info_v3-3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Edit Info pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here it is possible to write multiple line of information.</p>

<p>Pressing Enter/Please will close the pop-up. To add multiple lines it is necessary to press and hold shift while pressing Enter/Please.</p>
