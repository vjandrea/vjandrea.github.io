		<h1>Patching, DMX, and Fixture Setup</h1>
		
		<p>Patching is one word for everything that has to do with the fixtures we have in our show, how they are addressed - both signal wise but also for selecting them - and how they are arranged in a virtual 3D room.</p>

<p>The following pages deals with adding fixtures to your show, giving them DMX addresses, arranging them in the Stage view and all the connected topics. We are not going to look at details about the Fixture types nor how to control the fixtures. For this please have a look at <a href="key_basic_fixture.html">Basic Fixture types</a>, <a href="key_advanced_fixture_types.html">Advanced Fixture types</a> and <a href="key_operate_fixtures.html">Controlling Fixtures</a>.</p>
