		<h1>Layer in Sheets</h1>
		
		<p>Layers are displayed in form of a bar, which is located at the bottom of a sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The layers in some sheets are conform. Others, on the other hand, may differ from one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This chapter displays these differences as well as conformities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are the following sheets:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="key_of_layers_in_sheets_channel_and_fixture.html">Channel sheet and fixture sheet</a></li>
	<li><a href="key_of_layers_in_sheets_content_and_tracking.html">Sequence content and sequence tracking sheet</a></li>
</ul>
