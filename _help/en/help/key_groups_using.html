		<h1>Using groups when programming</h1>
		
		<p>When some groups have been created, then they can be used during programming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groups are shortcuts to select fixtures.</p>

<p>There is no reference to the group stored anywhere. This means that if the group is changed after being used, then it will not affect the stored cues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The work flow is to tap a group in the pool, give it some values, and then maybe storing the values.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Using names or numbers</h2>

<p>Groups can be accessed by their names or numbers.</p>

<p>If group number 7 is named <strong>My Lights</strong>, then it is possible to use the command line and write</p>

<p><span class="syntax">Group 7 at 50</span> or <span class="syntax">g "My Lights" at 50</span> ("g" is the command shortcut for group).</p>

<p>If there are more groups called <strong>My Lights</strong> then all the groups with that name will get the value.</p>

<p>Capital letters are ignored. So <strong>My Lights</strong> and <strong>my lights</strong> are considered the same.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is possible to use an asterisk as a joker. Let us imagine that there are three groups called <strong>Wash 1</strong>, <strong>Wash 2</strong> and <strong>Wash 3</strong>.</p>

<p>If all three groups needs to get 50%, then all is needed is to write <span class="syntax">g wash* at 50</span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last example we did not need the quotation marks. They are needed if the name have a space in it. But if an asterisk is used then quotation is not needed, even though the resulting groups actually have a space in their names.</p>

<p>The asterisk can also be used in front of the name. If there are several groups with the word <strong>cold</strong> in the name and all of them needs to go to 60, then write the following <span class="syntax">g *cold* at 60</span>.</p>
