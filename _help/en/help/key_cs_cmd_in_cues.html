		<h1>Commands in cues</h1>

		<p>Each cue can execute a command. The commands are written in the CMD column in the <a href="key_cs_cue_sequence.html">Sequence Executor Sheet</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The commands are executed as soon as the cue is triggered. It is possible to delay the command by adding a time in the CMD Delay column.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to run multiple commands in the same cue, you can separate the commands with a semicolon.</p>

<p>As an alternative you could make cue parts and add a command in each part - remember to add a small CMD Delay, so all commands won't be executed at the same time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The commands are executed by the logged in user on the master station in a session. So be aware that it might not be the user who triggers the cue to run the commands.</p>

<p>If you need to trigger a command on a specific station, there's a useful keyword: <a href="key_keyword_remotecommand.html">RemoteCommand</a>.</p>
