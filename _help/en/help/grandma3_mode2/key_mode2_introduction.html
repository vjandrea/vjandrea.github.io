		<h1>What is Mode2?</h1>
		
		<p>The&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;Mode2&nbsp;is used to run the&nbsp;grandMA2&nbsp;software on a&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;console.</p>

<p>As the&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;console has a different physical layout compared to the&nbsp;grandMA2, the display of windows and bars, and pool objects also differs in Mode2.</p>

<p>The grandMA3 full-size and the light both feature Mode2, which runs the native grandMA2 software version 3.4 and later.</p>

<div class="restriction"><strong>Restriction:</strong><br />
Some of the sections and buttons of the grandMA3 console are not assigned in Mode2.&nbsp;<br />
These are:<br />
- Executor knobs in the executor section;&nbsp;<br />
- Upper and lower encoders along with the upper and lower encoder buttons 1 to 3 in the custom section;&nbsp;<br />
-Master knobs 1 to 2 and master buttons 1 to 2 in the master section;<br />
-In grandMA3 CRV versions always connect the screens subsequently starting with DisplayPort 1;<br />
-In grandMA3 CRV versions use at least one Full HD display and a touch display or a mouse.<br />
-All displays have to have a Full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1,080.</div>
