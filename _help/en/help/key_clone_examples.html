It is possible to clone from fixture types or to fixture types in presets only. For more information see <a href="key_clone_clone_presets.html">Clone presets</a>.</div>

<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong><br />
The cloning option <strong>Overwrite </strong>removes and &nbsp;replaces original data of the destination by new data.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>Clone Fixture to Fixture</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Example:</h3>

<p>If you clone fixture 1 to fixture 2 with the default option, i.e.,&nbsp;<strong>Low&nbsp;Prio&nbsp;Merge</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This process creates selective data for fixture 2.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fixture 2 now does the exact same thing it did before cloning.</li>
	<li>Fixture 2 keeps the data of fixture 1 in case fixture 2 should not have any data for specific objects.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Example:</h3>

<p>If you clone fixture 1 to fixture 2 with the option <strong>Merge</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This process creates selective data for fixture 2.</li>
	<li>Fixture 2 now does the exact same thing as fixture 1.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fixture 2 keeps its data in case fixture 1 should not have any data for specific objects.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Example:</h3>

<p>If you clone fixtures 1 and 2 to fixtures in group 10 in sequences 1 through 10:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This process copies data from fixtures 1 and 2 to fixtures in group 10 within sequence 1 through 10 only.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.Example:</h3>

<p>If you clone fixture 1 to fixture 2 with the option&nbsp;<strong>Overwrite</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This process creates selective data for fixture 2.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fixture 2 now does the exact same thing as fixture 1.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
