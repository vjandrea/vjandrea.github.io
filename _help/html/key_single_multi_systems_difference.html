		<h1>What is the difference between a single-user and a multi-user system</h1>
		
		<p>When talking about a system, we often actually mean a session.</p>

<p>An Ethernet network can have several sessions running.</p>

<p>A session can have one, some or many MA devices as members or listeners.</p>

<p>This page is attempt to describe some of the differences between the two systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Single User session</h2>

<p>In a single user session there is one operator/programmer. This person might have one or several stations (consoles or onPC).</p>

<p>When there is only one user, then all stations are logged in as the same user.</p>

<p>This have also been called a "Full Tracking Backup". The stations are all in sync and share the different views and the programmer content is the same on all stations.</p>

<p>This is useful for the single operator. If one station fails, then the operator can move to the other station and continue working without loosing anything.</p>

<p>This operator will usually have full rights to the entire system.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Multi User session</h2>

<p>In a multi user session, there are several operators. They might use the same stations and take turns (working in shifts or at different phases of the process). It can also be a system with multiple users working at the same time on different stations.</p>

<p>For this setup the operators need to create more Users and most likely more User Profiles. Each operator will then log into the station using their User and may control the complete system or just a part of the system.</p>

<p>The stations share the show file and the Executors are all in sync, but the users can have different views on the screens and their programmer is not shared - the output is.</p>

<p>Sometimes the systems are a combination; There are several operators (Multi User), but each operator have two (or more) stations logged in with their User (Full Tracking Backup).</p>

<p>In a Multi User system, you can have users with different operator rights. There are several levels of rights. They span from complete access to only being allowed to change the view.</p>

<p>The User Profiles can also be limited to only a specific world. This would only allow the user to access a part of the fixtures.</p>
