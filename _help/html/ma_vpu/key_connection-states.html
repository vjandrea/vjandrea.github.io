		<h1>Connection States</h1>
		
		<p>When you launch MA VPU (Video Processing Unit) it tries to connect to a session where its state is set to "Session Member"​.<br />
​The two states of the connection are indicated by the heart in the status bar. The blinking of the heart indicates the communication between the desk and MA VPU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ATTENTION: With the start of a new session (Create) the session founder overwrites all data of the other members. I.e. if a new session is founded by the MA VPU&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;data in the desk will be overwritten!&nbsp;</p>

<p>If more than one console, visualizer or onPC editor is connected to the network the connections to the equipment will have to be properly assigned.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The communication between consoles, visualizer, VPU applications and onPC editors takes place in sessions.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A session has only one founder. This is e.g. the master. On connection the founder transfers its data (fixture types) to the connected stations.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>From then on, all session members are synchronized and have equal rights.<br />
	If a fixture is edited at a connected station the change is reflected to the master and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Session always has one master and several stations.</p>

<p>The network configuration can be managed by the ‚Settings -&nbsp;Network’ dialog.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint</strong>:<br />
​If the session entry appears in red, the streaming version is wrong. You have to update the software.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upper part of the dialog shows the active sessions and their members in a tree view. MA VPU is marked green.</p>

<p><strong>sACN/Art-Net IP:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Use this listbox to select an IP address for the Art-Net communication of the Pixel Mapper (receive data only).&nbsp;</p>
