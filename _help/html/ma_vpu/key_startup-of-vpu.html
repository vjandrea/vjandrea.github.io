		<p>This chapter describes the startup of the MA VPU application.</p>

<div class="important"><strong>For Dongle Users only:</strong> To realize an auto start of the MA VPU application a startup software 'VPULoader.exe’ is installed on the target machine at:<br />

<p>This program is called by the operating system (e.g. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) in startup of the MA VPU.</p>

<p>At the initial start after the installation or the update of the MA VPU application, the end user license agreement is shown.</p>

<p>The MA VPU application will not start, until the end user license agreement is confirmed.</p>

<p>If you are using a MA VPU plus, the end user license agreement is shown at the internal touch display.</p>
