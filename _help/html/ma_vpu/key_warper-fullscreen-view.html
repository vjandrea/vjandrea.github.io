		<p>You can toggle the GUI (via Ctrl + Enter) and watch the manipulated output in real-time while dragging the image into the right position of the projection screen. Editing the warper objects can be done on the VPU machine simultaneously in the Warper Window and the Warper Fullscreen View. Or the VPU is remote controlled by another VPU PC that is connected via MA-Net. In both cases the warped output can be checked in real time:</p>
