		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<p>MA Lighting´s MA VPU&nbsp;– Video Processing Unit – is a dynamic range of solutions for the control, live access and alteration of videos, still images and 3D objects in real time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All videos, still images and 3D objects can be scaled, positioned, tiled, colored and managed directly from any grandMA2&nbsp;console. It is as simple as controlling any other fixture – just add the MA VPU to the network session. The entire operation relies on the highly intuitive well- established MA philosophy. In other words, if you know grandMA2, you will most definitely know the MA VPU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to the efficacy of the MA VPU&nbsp;all videos can be displayed in a resolution higher than Full HD. Furthermore, the internal output synchronization of the MA-Net2 ensures the highest frame and&nbsp;DMX&nbsp;synchronicity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horizontal and vertical softedge blending as well as keystone correction help to scale videos to any size. And there is more to it than that! The MA VPU offers a convenient functionality of 3D keystoning&nbsp;and enables the user to fit content to any 3D objects, regardless of size and shape. Furthermore, playback speed can be adjusted with the help of smooth speed control and the improvement of frame interpolation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, there is also a plethora of functions, features and effects such as frame blending, color boost, dynamic color key, contrast, brightness, hue, saturation as well as blur, sepia, black / white, ocean and many more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MA VPU&nbsp;can be programed via the grandMA2 console in blind and preview modes. This simplifies programing considerably. Also, the VPU has a Single-Layer-Crossfade mode which allows the user to program all content within the same layer.</p>

<p>The MA VPU has a pre-installed content library comprising more than 17 GB of professional content.&nbsp;</p>
