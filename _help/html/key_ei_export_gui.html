		<h1>Export by using user interface</h1>
		
		<p>There is a dedicated GUI for exporting <strong>Macros</strong>, <strong>Effects</strong>, <strong>Masks</strong>, <strong>MAtricks</strong>, <strong>Gobo Bitmaps</strong>, <strong>User Profiles</strong> and <strong>DMX&nbsp;Nodes</strong>.</p>

<p>All of these, except <strong>Gobo Bitmaps</strong> and <strong>DMX&nbsp;Nodes</strong>, works similar. In the following example, it is an effect that has to be exported.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong></p>

<p>To be able to export an effect, there needs to be at least one effect in the effect pool. If exporting to a USB stick, then a stick needs to be connected to the console or onPC.</p>

<p>Open the <strong>Setup menu</strong> and tap <span class="softkey">Import Export</span> followed by <span class="softkey">Export</span> and finally <span class="softkey">Effects</span></p>

<p>This opens a pop-up like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_export_effect_v3_3.png" />
<figcaption><em>Export effect pop-up</em></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Select the tab where&nbsp;to export the effect to. A USB stick called "Shows" is selected in the image above.</li>
	<li>Pick the effects to export on the left side. Select multiple effects by holding <span class="hardkey">Ctrl</span> on the keyboard and tapping the effects in the effect list. The selected effects get a blue background. The effects are exported to an XML file, that can contain one or more effects.</li>
	<li>On the right side, there are a list of existing XML files on the destination, selected in the tab above.</li>
	<li>Activating <span class="softkey">Always ask for Name</span>&nbsp;(tap it until the text is yellow), gives an opportunity&nbsp;to give the XML file a different name than the effect. If more than one effect is selected, you will always be asked for a new name.</li>
	<li>Tap <span class="softkey">Export</span>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Depending on the selections, you might be prompted for a name for the XML file.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>The selected effects are exported to the selected drive (Internal or to an USB stick)</p>

<h2>Export a Gobo&nbsp;Bitmap</h2>

<p>This opens a pop-up like this:</p>

<figure class="caption"><img alt="" src="../../img/popup_export_gobo-bitmaps_v3_3.png" />

	<li>Select the manufacture and then pick the bitmap to export on the left side. Select multiple bitmaps by holding&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Ctrl</span>&nbsp;on the keyboard and tapping the bitmaps in the list. The selected bitmaps get a yellow background.</li>
	<li>On the right side, there is a list of existing bitmaps on the destination, selected in the tab above.</li>
	<li>Tap&nbsp;<span class="softkey">Export</span>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If a bitmap has to be deleted from the internal gobo library or the USB stick, select the bitmap and tap <span class="softkey">Delete</span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>The selected bitmaps are exported to the selected USB stick.</p>
