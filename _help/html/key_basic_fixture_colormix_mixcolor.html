		<h1>ColorMix vs. MixColor</h1>
		
		<p>There are two words used when talking about color systems in the fixtures. They are very similar and can be confused - especially because what is now called MixColor has been called ColorMix in the past!</p>

<p>This topic explains the difference between the two.</p>

<p>Please read the <a href="key_basic_fixture_attribute_feature_preset.html">What are Attributes, Features and Preset Types topic</a> before reading this if you have any doubts what it is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ColorMix</h2>

<p>ColorMix is currently used as an attribute for build in color functions in fixtures. Some fixtures have an attribute that allows for the operator to select a factory defined color in the fixtures. These are often tried to match defined colors from the gel manufacturers. These can use a variety of colors systems (color wheels, LED, and variable color wheels or flags) to produce the selected color.</p>

<p>Another use for the ColorMix word is as a speed attribute in the <strong>Control</strong> preset type. This often refers to a build in function in the fixture that allows the use of a DMX channel to change the fade time for all color systems in the fixture.</p>

ColorMix (CM) was used in previous software versions as a name for what is now called MixColor</div>

<h2>MixColor</h2>

<p>MixColor is word used by MA for color systems that mixes the desired color using additive (colored LEDs) or subtractive (CMY systems) color systems in the fixtures.</p>

<p>The common element is that the color system uses three or more variable colors. LED systems can have more than three colors. The Attribute is called COLORRGB in the library.</p>

<p>There is currently 22 defined ColorRGBs. They are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Red</li>
	<li>Green</li>
	<li>Blue</li>
	<li>Amber</li>
