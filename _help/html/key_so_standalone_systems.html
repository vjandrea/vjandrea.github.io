		<h1>Standalone systems</h1>
		
		<p>If a console is not connected to anything, then it is a <strong>Standalone</strong> system. It is also a standalone system using a grandMA2 onPC with one or more grandMA2 onPC wings connected.</p>

<p>A console is in standalone mode when it is not a part of a session. So a console that is connected to network, but not in a running session is also considered as Standalone.</p>

<p>The current status can be seen in the Setup menu (press the <span class="hardkey">Setup</span> key). The right tab will display: <strong>Network Standalone</strong>.</p>

<p>If the console is in a session and you want to set it to Standalone mode, then you can leave the session. This can be done using the <a href="key_network_session_end_leave.html">GUI</a> or the command line (<a href="key_keyword_leavesession.html">LeaveSession</a>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Standalone mode the console is limited to only controlling the amount of <a href="key_so_paramters_vs_dmx_channels.html">parameters</a> the console / onPC unlocks.</p>

<p>You can only use the DMX ports on the console / wings.</p>

<p>If DMX is output via an Ethernet connection, then the console needs to be in a session. Enable the <span class="softkey">Network DMX if Alone</span> button in the Setup-&gt;Network-&gt;Network Protocols. Even though not connected to anything else, it still needs to run an active session.</p>

<p>For more about setting up DMX ports, please have a look at the <a href="key_network_dmx_configure_ports.html">Configure the DMX ports on MA devices</a> topic.</p>
