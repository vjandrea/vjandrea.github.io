		<h1>Partial Show Read</h1>
		
		<p>Partial Show Read is a function used to import elements from one show into a different show.</p>

<p>The setup of the two shows are compared and you can choose what setup is wanted or a mix can be chosen.</p>

<p>After the comparison - called initialization - then access is granted to a new menu where different wanted elements can be chosen for import.</p>

<p>The actual process is more complex, but this is the idea. Please read the <a href="key_psr.html">Partial Show Read</a> chapters to learn more about it.</p>
