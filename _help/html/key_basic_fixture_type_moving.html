		<h1>Moving Lights</h1>
		
		<p>The Moving Light fixture type is the moving head or moving body fixtures.</p>

<p>They are historically fitted with a discharge light source. Especially in the later years then is no longer necessarily the truth. LED light sources are currently a big factor in modern small to medium size moving lights. For Profile type fixtures it is still the primary idea that it is a white light source that we filter wavelengths from to create different colors. For the Wash light fixtures it is now mostly LED light sources with multiple colors that changes the colors based on additive color mixing.</p>

<p>The default 3D model is a mowing head fixture.</p>
