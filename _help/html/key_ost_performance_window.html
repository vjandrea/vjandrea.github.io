		<h1>Performance window</h1>
		
		<p>To access the&nbsp;<strong>Performance&nbsp;</strong>window, tap on an empty part of a screen. This must be at least 2 columns wide and 2 rows high. Tap&nbsp;<span class="softkey">System</span>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<span class="softkey">Performance</span>.</p>

<p>The Performance window opens.</p>

<p>The performance window is a monitor of internal workloads and a debug tool. It has two different modes, <strong>Realtime</strong> and <strong>Draw</strong>. As default it opens in realtime.</p>

<p>It is a monitor of the workload of the desk. The first six rows are incoming&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;and the last rows are outgoing traffic.</p>

<p>The different loads have different colors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Red -&nbsp;DMX data</li>
	<li>Green - MA Net feedback</li>
	<li>Blue - Station feedback (MA stations = 1 ms / Windows &gt; 1 ms)</li>
	<li>Yellow - Network Protocols</li>
</ul>

<p>The lines on the left side of the view are showing tasks with a high calculation priority. The lines on the right side shows tasks with a normal priority.</p>

<p>The small line that are only 2 rows high, show traffic via USB connections (Command and Fader Wing for example) while the long lines that are 8 rows high, show traffic via&nbsp;ethernet&nbsp;or&nbsp;DMX.</p>

<p>The traffic for incoming USB connections are on line 7 and 8, while outgoing USB traffic is on line 9 and 10.</p>

<p>If the yellow lines (Art-Net traffic for example) are shown side by side in the lower part, then there is a delay on the outputted universes. To adjust this delay go to Setup - Network – Network Protocols and adjust the Delay column.</p>

<p>There are two buttons in the upper right corner of the Performance window</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="softkey">Pause</span>&nbsp;freezes the display</li>
	<li><span class="softkey">Realtime/Draw</span>&nbsp;switch the window between <strong>Realtime</strong> and <strong>Draw​</strong></li>
</ul>
