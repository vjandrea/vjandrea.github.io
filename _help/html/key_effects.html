		<h1>Effects</h1>
		
		<p>An effect is an automated movement or change of color. In other words, it is an automated modulation of attributes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Dimmer channel that runs the fixtures in a sinusoid between two values – high and low.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2><a id="effect_modes" name="effect_modes"></a>Effect Modes</h2>

<p>There are four effect modes that are displayed in form of letters in the upper right corner of each object in the effect pool:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>A:</strong><br />
	A stands for an absolute effect. It moves in an absolute manner between the low and high values.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>R:</strong><br />
	R stands for a relative effect. The low and high values are added onto the actual value.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip"><strong>Hint:</strong><br />
Relative values are mainly used in pan and tilt.&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li><strong>S:</strong><br />
	S stands for a selective effect. It is only valid for fixtures that are linked to this effect.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>T:</strong><br />
	T stands for a template effect. It is valid for all fixtures that contain the attributes of a particular effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on the selective and template effects see <a href="key_effects_template_and_selective.html">Use template and selective effects</a>.&nbsp;</p>
