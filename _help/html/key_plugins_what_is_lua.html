		<h1>What is Lua</h1>
		
		<p>Lua is a scripting language designed to support general procedural programming. &nbsp;It offers support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming. Lua is implemented as a library, written in&nbsp;<em>clean</em>&nbsp;C (common subset of ANSI&nbsp;C and C++).</p>
