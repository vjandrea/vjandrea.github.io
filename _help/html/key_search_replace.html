		<h1>Search and Replace</h1>
		
		<p>The two functions <strong>Search</strong> and <strong>Replace</strong> are two very powerful tools in the grandMA2.</p>

<p><strong>Search</strong> can be used to find a where different elements are used.</p>

<p><strong>Replace</strong> is also doing a search, but it then uses the search result to replace one element with another. This can also be ranges of elements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no graphic interface for these two functions. It is all done by typing in the command line entry.</p>

<p>There are some nice predefined macros for many of the search and replace functions - please read more about loading predefined macros in the <a href="key_ei_import_predefined.html">Import Predefined Objects topic</a>.</p>
