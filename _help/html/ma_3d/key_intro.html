<p>MA Lighting´s visualizer and preprograming studio – the PC software MA 3D – is an extremely powerful tool created for the visualization and design of three-dimensional stage layouts. Conventional and moving light fixtures can be displayed together with any grandMA2 console or the grandMA2 onPC program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MA 3D allows a straight forward design and setup of any custom stage or scenery layout with its 2D drawing facilities and a library of basic graphical elements. Multiple windows – both in 2D&nbsp;or 3D view with any camera angle – can be&nbsp;opened simultaneously and are updated in real time. All stage elements can be positioned in x, y, z directions and can also be rotated about their axes. This equipment can be moved freely in the 3D space via the grandMA2 console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the many advantages of MA 3D is that it is stored in the same show file in the grandMA2 system. No matter where you are or what type of grandMA2&nbsp;console or MA equipment you use you always have the complete show file with you!</p>

<p>The MA 3D application runs on powerful&nbsp;Windows® PCs and communicates with the grandMA2 console via network.&nbsp;</p>
