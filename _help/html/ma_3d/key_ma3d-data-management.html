		<h1>Data Management</h1>
		
		<p>This section describes how data is managed by the grandMA2 console and the MA 3D visualizer. Both can work independently. If they are connected in a MA network session the grandMA2 console will be the master and send the current&nbsp;showfile to the connected MA 3D. Data changed within MA 3D is transferred to the grandMA2 console and vice versa. MA 3D and the grandMA2 console use the same show files (.show.gz).</p>
