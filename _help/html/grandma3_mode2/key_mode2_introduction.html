		<h1>What is Mode2?</h1>
		
		<p>The&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;Mode2&nbsp;is used to run the&nbsp;grandMA2&nbsp;software on a&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;console.</p>

<p>As the&nbsp;grandMA3&nbsp;console has a different physical layout compared to the&nbsp;grandMA2, the display of windows and bars, and pool objects also differs in Mode2.</p>

<p>The grandMA3 full-size and the light both feature Mode2, which runs the native grandMA2 software version 3.4 and later.</p>
