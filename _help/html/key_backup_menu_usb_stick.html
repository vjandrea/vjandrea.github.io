		<h1>Using a USB stick</h1>
		
		<p>There are different things to keep in mind when using a USB stick.</p>

<p>Here is a list of good advice for the USB stick.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not use a big stick. Do not go above 16Gb.</li>
	<li>Name the stick, but <strong>do not</strong> use a space in the name. Underscore or Dash are ok.</li>
	<li>It should be formatted in FAT32.</li>
	<li>If the stick have been in a Mac or PC make sure it has not been configured as something other than a "removable disk".</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not rules in all software versions. But it is a list of advice that have been gathered by limitations in different software version.</p>

<p>So maybe not rules, but at least a good advice.</p>
