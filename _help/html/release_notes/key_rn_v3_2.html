		<h1>Release Notes - Version 3.2</h1>
		
		<p>New functions and features in detail:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>How to:</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>To activate the RDM the user has to switch RDM on globally. It is possible to do so in Setup/Console/Global Settings or in Setup/Show/Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule/RDM Devices.</li>
		<li>It is possible to switch the RDM off and on separately for every universe in the universe pool or in Setup/Show/Patch Only(Live)/DMX list.</li>
		<li>It is now possible for the user to do the first steps in the new RDM Sheet. The new RDM sheet lists all fixtures discovered per RDM. The RDM sheet shows all RDM information. The user changes the RDM parameters for single fixtures here(e.g. DMX start address, etc.) by editing the corresponding cell. The RDM sheet shows sensor values also.</li>
		<li>All discovered RDM fixtures are displayed in Setup/Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule/RDM Devices and can be matched to the fixtures of the grandMA2 patch via the match to fixture function on the bottom. The button identify activates the identify mode of the selected RDM device in the lighting rig. This helps the operator to match RDM fixtures with fixtures in the patch.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New commands for RDM:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>New command RDMSetParameter
	<ul>
		<li>RDMSetParameter &lt;PID&gt; &lt;Value&gt;/UID=&lt;UID&gt; /multipatch=&lt;multipatch&gt;</li>
		<li>PID - can be the name, as IDENTIFY_DEVICE or a hex number, e.g. 1000.</li>
		<li>Value - e.g. 200 if PID is DMX_START_ADDRESS, DMX address of Fixture will be changed to 200; Value could not be specified for such PIDs as FACTORY_DEFAULTS.</li>
		<li>UID - for sending message to specific device.</li>
		<li>Multi Patch - 0 = for all multi patch, 1.. = for specific multi patch fixture index.</li>
		<li>If this command is entered at a connected console, the master will get the command remote for each UID.</li>
		<li>RDMSetParameter works also with the current selection.</li>
		<li>Supported PIDs:
		<ul>
			<li>FACTORY_DEFAULTS</li>
			<li>LANGUAGE</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New Command RDMAutoMatch
	<ul>
		<li>RDMAutoMatch &lt;Object&gt;</li>
		<li>If no Object is set, the current selection will be used.</li>
		<li>Possible objects are: Channel, Fixture, Fixture Type, RDMFixture Type, Group, Sequence, Cue, Executor, Preset(only selective), Selection.</li>
		<li>To get the IDs for the objects enter the RDMFixture Types cd RDM_Data/RDM_Fixture_Types into the command line.</li>
		<li>Rules for RDMAutoMatch:
		<ul>
			<li>MA Fixture and RDM Fixture have to have the same DMX address.</li>

		<li>This command is a shortcut for the command RDMSetParameter DMX_START_ADDRESS x</li>
		<li>Available options are: multi patch, UID.</li>
		<li>Multi patch: sets RDM DMX address of a specific multi patch device.</li>
		<li>UID: changes RDM DMX address of a specific UID.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New command RDMList
	<ul>
		<li>RDMList &lt;Object&gt;</li>
		<li>RDMList generates a list of RDM data in MA2 system. If no object is specified, all RDM data is taken.</li>

<ul>
	<li>RDM alerts and RDM warnings:
	<ul>
		<li>If there are RDM notifications for a fixture, fixture sheet and layouts have indicators for RDM Alerts(red) and Warnings(yellow).</li>
		<li>RDM notifications depend on the type parameter(e.g. LAMP_STATE, DMX_PERSONALITY, etc.) or the sensor(temperature, fan speed, e.g.).</li>
		<li>The user decides whether it is an RDM Alert or RDM Warning for each notification.</li>
		<li>RDM Alerts and Warnings are also shown in the Message Center. An RDM symbol appears in the area of the Message Center of the Command line.</li>
		<li>RDM Alerts and Warnings can be set to Status(Message-Center-Area in the command line) and/or pop-up.</li>
		<li>All RDM icons in Universe pool turn red if RDM is disabled in Global Settings.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>It is possible to export and import RDM information(including ESTAId, DeviceModelId, SoftwareVersionId and DmxPersonalityId) and notifications with the Fixture Type.</li>
	<li>Added RDM button in Edit fixture pop-up.</li>
	<li>Implemented RDM filters for fixture sheet and channel sheet, layouts and masks.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>New bitmap fixture</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>How to:
		<ul>
			<li>To choose an image or video change to video preset type and turn the encoder of attribute image to switch through the images of the image pool.</li>
			<li>Creating a rectangle in a layout opens the edit rectangle dialog.</li>
			<li>The content played back will be resized to the rectangle as the rectangle provides the aspect ratio for the bitmap fixture.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>New features for bitmap fixture implemented:
		<ul>
			<li>Some sample images and videos for bitmap fixtures are available in the bitmap folder.</li>
			<li>Limitation of the image pool is a total of 100MB and has a maximum size of 64MB for a single object.</li>
			<li>There are two ways of using the bitmap fixture with images: enter At and image into the command line or press At and tap an image in the image pool.</li>
			<li>There are two ways of using the bitmap fixture with layouts also: enter At and layout into the command line or press At and tap at a layout in the layout pool.</li>
			<li>If the At mode for the layout pool is active, tapping a layout sets the layout for the bitmap fixture. If the select mode for the layout pool is active, tapping a layout shows the layout in the layout view.</li>
			<li>Support of PNG Alpha.</li>
			<li>Added Z position attribute. Z pos only works within the same priority, e.g. programmer or LTP or HTP, etc. When mixing programmer Z pos with Z pos of an HTP playback will not work properly.</li>
			<li>Speed control for playing back videos.</li>
			<li>Added play modes for bitmap effects: play loops endlessly. Play Once will play clip one time, and stop with the last frame. Play Once Off plays clip one time, and fade out with the last frame.</li>
			<li>Improvements for rendering the Content at the Fixtures. The issue was that Pixels were not positioned correctly or colors were fading out at the borders.</li>
			<li>Rotation function added: Rotation, Rotation Center X and Rotation Center Y.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Implemented modes for bitmap effects:
		<ul>
			<li>Dim is default for only dimmer fixtures; RGB is default for fixtures with RGB.</li>
			<li>Additional modes are possible: RGB+Dim, and presets (All, Dimmer, Position, Gobo, Color, Beam, Focus, Control, Shapers and Video).</li>
			<li>"Black and white presets"(VP1 and VP2) can also be chosen for the preset modes in the bitmap fixture.</li>
			<li>The number adjusted for VP1 and VP2 refers to the corresponding preset of the chosen preset type.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added 100 channel sets for images and outputs to the bitmap Fixture Type.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Internal time code generator</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Implemented internal timecode generator.</li>
		<li>A timecode generator can be configured with edit TimecodeSlot X for every timecode slot.</li>
		<li>To start, stop or pause the generator uses the commands Go TimecodeSlot X, Pause TimecodeSlot X or Off TimecodeSlot X</li>
		<li>The timecode generator can also operate within the clock view.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Light mode and web remote for MA xPort node</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The light mode for MA xPort nodes changes the intensity of the display.</li>
		<li>The light mode changes between black (dark) and full.</li>
		<li>Web remote for xPortNodes implemented. Connect with a browser to the IP of the xPortNode.</li>
		<li>Password for login is admin.</li>
		<li>It is possible for the user to change all the settings in the MA network configuration and via web remote.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Split up exec CLI into 2 options</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Exec CLI affects executors only .</li>
		<li>Default Go, Goback, Pause CLI affects the default Go+, Go- and Pause key of the 100mm faders.</li>
		<li>Both options can be changed separately in Setup - Console - Local Settings.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Improved preset workflow</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Storing and updating presets</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Set update menu settings and defaults for presets, effects and cues individually.</li>
			<li>Store and update presets are separated from store defaults. Defaults for updating the presets are in the update menu.</li>
			<li>Define defaults for store in the store options. To open this dialog hold the store button for two seconds.</li>
			<li>Define defaults for update in the update dialog. Press highlighted update button to open this dialog.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Improved cloning rules</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>New cloning rules:
			<ul>
				<li>The clone destination decides if the new data is global or selective.</li>
				<li>It is possible to clone from fixture to fixture, from fixture to Fixture Type, from Fixture Type to fixture or from Fixture Type to Fixture Type.</li>
				<li>Cloning to Fixtures adds selective data.</li>
				<li>Cloning to Fixture Types adds global data.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Examples:
			<ul>
				<li>Example 1: Preset contains global data for Fixture Type 1(fixture 1 is of Fixture Type 1, fixture 11 is of Fixture Type 2).
				<ul>
					<li>Cloning fixture 1 to fixture 11 creates selective data for fixture 11.</li>
					<li>Cloning fixture 1 at Fixture Type 2 creates global data for Fixture Type 2. Fixtures of Fixture Type use this preset.</li>
					<li>Cloning Fixture Type 1 at Fixture Type 2 creates global data for Fixture Type 2.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Example 2: Preset contains selective Data for Fixture 1.
				<ul>
					<li>Cloning fixture 1 to fixture 11 creates selective data for fixture 11.</li>
					<li>Cloning fixture 1 at Fixture Type 2 creates global data for Fixture Type 2.</li>
					<li>Cloning Fixture Type 1 at Fixture Type 2 does not create new data as there is no global data for Fixture Type 1 that could be cloned.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<p><strong>MA VPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>At the initial start after the installation or the update of the VPU-application, the end user licence agreement is shown. The MA VPU application will not start, until the end user licence agreement is confirmed. If you are using a VPU Plus, the end user licence agreement is shown at the internal touch display. If you are using a VPU basic or VPU light, the end user licence agreement is shown at the first external DVI-output - so please make sure you have a display and a mouse attached to the VPU Basic or VPU Light. At the end user licence agreement the user has the choice to install additional third party codecs, which can be used at the new Hap-Converter.</li>
	<li>Added a 64-bit version of the VPU application:
	<ul>
		<li>Setup file contains the 64-bit and 32-bit binaries.</li>
		<li>The 64-bit application will automatically be installed, if you are running a 64-bit OS.</li>
		<li>MA VPU Setup now installs the Main Concept 32-bit and 64-bit MPEG-2 Demo Decoder in accordance to the operation system. If you own a licensed version of the Main Concept Decoder and you are running the VPU application on a Media PC with a 64-bit OS, you need to install the Main Concept 64-bit MPEG-2 Decoder Pack manually.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>MA VPU now supports playback of video clips using the Hap-Codec:
	<ul>
		<li>Hap is an open-source GPU accelerated video codec.</li>
		<li>The main benefits of Hap are:
		<ul>
			<li>Increased performance</li>
			<li>Playback of clips with a resolution higher than 1920x1080</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Support of alpha-transparency:
		<ul>
			<li>There are 3 formats of Hap-Clips: Hap1, HapQ and HapAlpha</li>
			<li>Hap1: Good quality, higher compression, smaller files, higher CPU load, less hard-disk load</li>
			<li>HapQ: Best quality, lower compression, bigger files, less CPU load, higher hard-disk load</li>
			<li>HapAlpha: support of Alpha-channel</li>
			<li>To convert a media-clip to Hap, the resolution in both dimensions must be a multiple of 4. Important: If you are using the Hap Quicktime codec to encode media clips with tools like e.g. After Effects, we strongly recommend to use version 8. Hap Clips created with the Hap Quicktime codec version 9 are not supported and can not be played back.</li>
			<li>If the additional third party codecs are not installed, Hap can only be played back from an avi-container. If the additional third party codecs are installed, Hap can be played back from an avi- and a mov-container.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added the Hap Converter:
		<ul>
			<li>The new built in Hap Converter allows to convert clips from MPEG2 to Hap or from Hap to Hap, if the additional third party codecs are not installed.</li>
			<li>If the additional 3rd party codecs are installed, content with various formats can be converted to Hap.</li>
			<li>Additional third party codecs can not be used to play back media content, but only to convert files to Hap.</li>
			<li>Supported additional video-codecs are: H.264, H.265, MPEG-4, Apple ProRes (without support of alpha channel), Quicktime Animation (with support of alpha channel), Theora and VP8.</li>
			<li>Supported additional audio-codecs are: AAC, AC3, Flac, Opus and Vorbis.</li>
			<li>Supported additional media-containers are: flv, mkv, mov, m4v, mp4, ogg and webm.</li>
			<li>If you go to the Content Editor-Tab, the Hap Converter will be shown at the docking frame.</li>
			<li>The Hap Conversion Options are:
			<ul>
				<li>"Auto convert new Content" - If the check box is enabled, all content, which is inserted to the show will be converted to the options given.</li>
				<li>"Delete Source after Conversion" - If the check box is enabled, the source file will be deleted after the conversion is done.</li>
				<li>"Compress": If the check box is enabled, the clip will be additionally compressed, which results in a smaller file size with a variable bitrate. If the check box is disabled, the clip will not be additionally compressed, which results in a bigger file size with a constant bitrate.</li>
				<li>"Overwrite": Files with the same filename will be overwritten by the converter, if the check box is enabled.</li>
				<li>"Format": You can choose between Hap1, HapQ, HapAlpha and Auto. If you choose "Auto", a MPEG2 File will be converted to Hap1. If the source is a Hap-File, its format will not be changed during conversion.</li>
				<li>"Change Resolution": If enabled, you can define the resolution of the resulting clip. Also there is the option to keep the ratio of the source.</li>
				<li>The converted Hap-file will be in the same directory of the hard disc as the source file.</li>
				<li>"Start Conversion": This button starts the conversion of the selected clips. Files can be selected within the Content Editor or the Browser of the Hap Converter. So you are able to convert clips, which are not added to the show.</li>
				<li>Selected Content State (left of the Hap Conversion Options) shows the attributes of a selected media file and also works with a multi selection of media files.</li>
				<li>The tab "Job-queue" at the Hap Converter shows the queue of the conversion jobs and additional information of the actually running job. There are also three buttons, which belongs to the jobqueue:
				<ul>
					<li>"Pause": Pauses the Converter.</li>
					<li>"Delete": Deletes the jobs, that are selected. This only deletes the conversion-job, but will not delete the file itself or will remove the file from the show.</li>
					<li>"Top Priority": If you press this button, the selected jobs will be set to the top position of the queue.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Converter jobs are not saved to the show file, but locally on the VPU. If you shutdown or restart the VPU, the jobs will not get lost. This offers the advantage, that you can use the Converter standalone. Status messages of the Hap Converter can be found at the Info dialog of the Dialog Docking Frame. There is also a new filter option "Converter". The Converter is automatically paused during Showmode.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="tip"><strong>Note:</strong><br />
To convert a media-clip to Hap, the resolution in both dimensions must be a multiple of 4.</div>

<ul>
	<li>Improved the Content Editor:
	<ul>
		<li>Channel sets now show a small icon, which indicates if a video clip is Hap1, HapQ, HapAlpha or MPEG.</li>
		<li>Sound files now will be tagged with a small sound-icon.</li>
		<li>Channel sets now show additional information of the Hap Converter.</li>
		<li>There is a progress bar, which shows the state of the conversion.</li>
		<li>The small number shows the actual position of the conversion-job in the queue of the Converter.</li>
		<li>The "+" gives you the option to set a conversion-job to top priority.</li>
		<li>The pause-button pauses the Converter. The Converter can be (re-)started by pressing the play-button.</li>
		<li>An conversion-job can be deleted by pressing the button, that shows a "trash-bin".</li>
		<li>Files and folders now can be inserted to the show by drag and drop from the browser below the Hap Converter.</li>
		<li>Content Preview at the Content Editor now supports alpha-transparency.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pixel Mapper:
	<ul>
		<li>Pixel Mapper Priority: It is now possible to set a priority for each output of the Pixel Mapper. The Pixel Mapper priority is quite simpler than executor priority. If there is a equal or higher priority for a fixture coming from the desk, the Pixel Mapper sets its output for these fixtures to black. So the desk gets full control about the fixture. The Pixel mapper Priority can be set at the Output Options at the Pixel Mapper Editor of the VPU and the VPU Pixel Mapper View of the desk. A fade-in-time and fade-out-time can be set by a new attribute called "PM-Fade", which can be found at the preset-type "Control" of the VPU Camera-Fixure. The fadetime can be set between 0 and 10 seconds. The default value is 0 seconds.</li>
		<li>Pixel mapper output by Art-Net and sACN now supports Unicast.</li>
		<li>Pixel mapper network statistic now shows tries per cycle and count of universes send per cycle.</li>
		<li>Delete hard key now also works to delete fixtures at the VPU Pixel Mapper View in the desk. For this reason the delete soft key has been removed from the Pixel Mapper View.</li>
		<li>Pixel Mapper Art-Net/sACN-start universe: It is now possible to remap the patch of a Pixel Mapper Output. Therefore a new start universe can be defined at the options of the Pixel Mapper Output. Art-Net/sACN Start is set for the lowest universe used in this Pixel Mapper Output. If Art-Net/sACN-Start is set to "Original", the patched universes from the grandMA2 are used.</li>
		<li>Pixel mapper Output by Art-Net and sACN now supports Unicast.</li>
		<li>Added Title button to change the arrangement of the view at the VPU Pixel Mapper View of the desk.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>New VPU Fixture Types implemented:
	<ul>
		<li>VPU Layer: Added attributes for routing to camera 9-16.</li>
		<li>Added channel-sets for virtual inputs 9-16.</li>
		<li>Changed values for VPU play modes.</li>
		<li>VPU Camera: added pixel mapper fade time</li>
		<li>added field of view</li>
		<li>added camera rotation</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The new fixture type may not be compatible with existing shows. If you have replaced the VPU layer fixture type of your existing show with the new one, please make sure to run the new predefined macro "Replace VPU play modes" once to convert the play mode values.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Updated VPU demo show, VPU new show and VPU teaser show.</li>
	<li>MA VPU now supports 16 cameras. Also 16 virtual out- and inputs are supported now.</li>
	<li>DHCP: Network configuration of a VPU now supports DHCP. If DHCP is enabled, the VPU tries to get its IP address from a DHCP-server in the network. If there is no DHCP-server present, but DHCP is activated, the VPU sets an IP address within the APIPA-Range (169.254.x.y).</li>
	<li>File -&gt; Make a Screen-shot: Use this to make a screen shot of the outputs. The screen shots are saved to C:\Users\MA\Documents - you can get to this directory by the VPU-Browser.</li>
	<li>Added Special Dialogs to the desk for improved and comfortable handling of Border (VPU-Layer), Softedge and Keystone (VPU-Camera).</li>
	<li>Show-mode also disables FPS in full screen.</li>
	<li>Filters at Docking frame -&gt; Info are arranged in alphabetical order.</li>
	<li>Delete-key of an attached keyboard now works as a shortcut to delete files at the browser.</li>
	<li>GUI now indicates if there is no Pixel Mapper-Output, because the Pixel Mapper is globally disabled at the Global VPU Settings.</li>
	<li>A Fixture Layer can now be assigned to a VPU via the command line or a Macro: The command at cd Netconfig/VPU is: Assign &lt;ID&gt;/Layer=Name with &lt;ID&gt;=ID of the VPU and Name=Name of the Fixture Layer you want to assign. The Name needs to be in \", if the name contains blanks.</li>
	<li>Delay for Outputs: It is now possible to set a delay for every DVI- and Pixel Mapper-Output of a VPU. These delays can be set separately for every output to align the outputs in time, if there are different signal run times between the output of the VPU and e.g. your projectors or LED-walls. Delay for the DVI-outputs can be set at the Display-Settings between 0 and 15 frames with regard to the refresh rate of your DVI-outputs. Delay for the Pixel Mapper can be set at the options of every output between 0 and 8/30 seconds. An audio delay can be set at the Main Options between 0 and 15 frames with regard to the refresh rate of the DVI-outputs.</li>
	<li>Camera-Rotation and FOV: The VPU Camera-Fixture now supports camera-rotation. Two kinds of rotation are possible. First option is to rotate the Camera around its own centerpoint and the second option is to rotate the Camera around the centerpoint of the 3D space of the VPU. Also the Field of view (FOV) of the VPU Camera Fixture now can be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Improved support for running VPU on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.</li>
	<li>Windows 10: MA VPU now supports more than one output. However the performance is decreased due to limitations of Windows 10, if more than one output is used. In this case a pop-up will appear.</li>
	<li>Improved Memory-Graph in Dialog Docking Frame</li>
	<li>Implemented functionality for un-installing the VPU application at "Programs and Features" of the Windows Control Panel.</li>
	<li>Un-installing of the VPU application now also deletes the related folder at the Windows Start-Menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed MA VPU bugs and improved functionality</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed - Graphical View at the VPU Pixel Mapper View will not be zoomed far out anymore, if you leave "Areas and Outputs" after you have changed the focus to another area.</li>

<p><strong>Appendix:</strong></p>

<div class="warning">RDM: Connecting 2 Outputs of a grandMA2-System with one cable can cause trouble in RDM.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;A Fixture needs to be re-patched, if the Fixture Type is exchanged with a similar one, which has a different patch-order of the instances.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;Down-dating to grandMA2 Release v3.0.0.5 and earlier requires a Factory reset (Format and Install). Please backup your show files before down-dating.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;Inserting the command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers of fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;When multiple fixtures are selected with a lasso in the layout view, the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons are respected. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;The network switch IGMP Snooping functionality has to be switched off in order to be able to update MA 2Port nodes.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;A grandMA1 compatibility mode is no part of grandMA2 console software 3.0 and later. When grandMA1 compatibility mode is needed, grandMA2 consoles and MA NPUs have to be down-dated to grandMA2 v2.9.1.1.</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;The MA-Net2 protocol has changed to support the 8Port Node devices. All MA devices need a new network streaming protocol with the 2.9 software. Once updated to the correlating version to grandMA2 v2.9, 2Port, 4Port, 8Port, NSP 4Port Node and the NDP will no longer work in a session with an older network streaming protocol (e.g. grandMA2 v2.8). Down-dating MA 2Port Nodes or NSP running in 4Port Node Mode to be v2.8 compatible is only possible via grandMA1 v 6.801. All other devices can be down-dated via USB or windows installer only.</div>

<div class="warning">Exec Time can be used for Executor buttons and Executor Faders. The new Executor option "Ignore Exec Time" has been added. When this option is enabled, the referring executor will use its own off time instead of the Exec Time Fader Timing. Show files stored with grandMA2 v2.9.1 and earlier will be converted. All Fader executors will have this option enabled. Executor option defaults are valid for fader and button executors. When storing new fader executors, these executors will listen to Exec Time by default.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;Fixture type preset reference contains values only. It is not possible to add any fade, delay or effect data to fixture type preset references.​</div>

<div class="warning">ASCII show import supports Strand, Transtechnik and ADB ASCII show files.&nbsp;</div>

<div class="warning">&nbsp;A CITP connection is not possible when running CITP sender and CITP receiver at the same computer.</div>

<div class="tip">&nbsp;Following syntax can be used to switch off faders only or buttons only of current page or of all pages except current page:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Faders of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Buttons of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100 Page Thru - $faderpage</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Faders of all pages except current.​</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240 Page Thru - $buttonpage</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Buttons of all pages except current.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<p>Addressing executors via command-line has been improved to provide support for addressing by name or number. This can be used when sending playback commands to specific executors or when storing to a specific executor, sequence or cue for example. All existing cue links and Macros of show files stored with former grandMA2 versions will be converted as far as possible. Please check cue links and Macros of existing shows when loading them the first time with this version. Some cue links and Macros may have to be adjusted. When creating new Macros or cue links or editing existing ones, the new syntax as described below has to be used.&nbsp;</p>
