<div class="important"><strong>Important:</strong>

<ul>
	<li>If you would like to update your dimMA system from any version below 6.x please contact your MA-dealer or MA direct for any update information. Should you be using grandMA2 in connection to our dimMA solutions, please get in touch with us, since a console update will now require a NDP update and vice versa. We are happy to assist you.</li>
	<li>The current versions of onPC and 3D require minimum Windows® XP with Service Pack 3 (Microsoft® .NET Framework (4.0) will be installed on your computer, if not already installed).</li>
	<li>With Version 2.5.70 the default speed of effects and the rate of effect lines has been exchanged by a single speed per line. Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Please check your show file with the new version before using it live!!</li>

<h2>Release - Version 2.6.0</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New functions and features </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Playback</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Xfade is now aborting x-fade if fader returns to 0%</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Pools</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Pools: objects can be moved around as long as the "Move Button" is switched on.( similar to grandMA series 1)</li>
		<li>New Command "Insert" in Pool ( press 2 times "Move"-Button )</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sheets</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixture, channel, tracking and content sheets: frames of empty cells can be suppressed in the option menu via "Hide Empty Cells"</li>
		<li>New button in sequence view / option menu: "Hide timing countdown". If active absolute values will be displayed and not the cue timing countdown</li>
		<li>Track Sheet: with the tracking options presets can be exchanged or the value of an attribute exchanged with a preset. The available presets are shown in the calculator with the preset numbers. The destination button in the tracking option pop-up is now also valid for preset exchange</li>
		<li>New functionality in user options (setup/user/window settings/preset) -&gt;"Reset all preset pool colors"</li>
		<li>Running effect view: New Button: "Follow selection". This decides whether the current selection is respected in "Release Mode" or "Stomp Mode". If switched off then Release/Stomp will be executed for all fixtures of an effect, regardless of the fixture selection</li>
		<li>View Pool: New option: Symbols / no symbols: content view of screen can be shown. Only possible when one monitor is in that view</li>
		<li>Agenda: pressing the encoder pops up a new calculator which makes it easier to edit the entries</li>
		<li>Profile editor: Scale conversion either percent or decimal</li>
		<li>Exec Mini Dialog: When an executor is locked, the number in the exec mini sheet is displayed in red. Similar for the sequence number</li>
		<li>MATricks Load predefined provide access to all predefined MATricks stored at the predefined.xml</li>
		<li>Live effect bar ( Quick &amp; dirty Encoderbar ) : Buttons "Off effect", "release effect" and "stomp effect" added</li>

		<li>First MAtricks pool object is now "Reset" (MAtricks)</li>
		<li>MAtricks encoder bar: Circular copy, shuffle selection buttons added</li>
		<li>Edit effect menu: New button "predefined". Predefined template effects can be loaded ( similar to the import function ). Effects corresponding to non-existing attributes in the show will be set to NONE.</li>
		<li>Form Editor and DMX Editor: Table mode has a separate index column per row to display the point index</li>
		<li>Preset in effect line is now shown in 2 lines: preset number and preset name</li>
		<li>Presets which only containing timing do show an Indicator for selective, global or universal</li>
		<li>Effect editor and effect special dialog: the button "value readout (for changing the columns "Low value" / "High Value" or "Center" / "Size" ) has an additional option "Auto". When "Auto" is selected columns are changing on their own - dependent on editing an relative or an absolute effect</li>
		<li>Menu which were restricted to be opened in screen 1 or 2 can be opened on all available screens now using the select screen pop-up.</li>
		<li>The store and the off menu can be opened at any screen using the select screen pop-up.</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Command line </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Is a view button in a pool pressed during an active move command the move command will not be interrupted</li>
		<li>Random for chasers is "lighting random", not real random. (like grandma1). That means, that it will be avoided to play 2 directly following cues</li>
		<li>During deleting Effect/Preset/Forms which are in use Console warn user that it is not oopsable. The elements will be restored but the link to the sequence lists not</li>
		<li>New button combination "MA+At+4" ( 4 e.g. for a number ) means Stomp presetype color</li>
		<li>New button combinations: 3 times &lt;&lt;&lt; brings an master fader of an executor to zero. 3 times &gt;&gt;&gt; to full</li>
		<li>Playbacks are now divided into 4 sections: value / value timing / effect / effect timing. Example: When a fixture with dimmer values and individual dimmer fade times is played back out of a sequence it is now possible to take only the fade time active into the programmer.</li>
		<li>Combining the store options "status merge" and "prog." will overtake the preset links. Combining "status merge" and "output" will not do so.</li>
		<li>Increased max multipatch to 1024 ( had been 15 before )</li>
		<li>New option for the commands "At", "Stomp" and release: "/IgnoreSelection" (Abbr. "/is" ). A command e.g. "Stomp Presettype Dimmer /is" does not regard the current selection</li>
		<li>New: Hard key access to PresetType: MA+Preset</li>

		<li>Long press store does not cancel already active store anymore.</li>
		<li>Import Export 3D cameras obeys camera name and rotation</li>
		<li>With the AT filter it is possible to apply multidimensional forms to specified attributes. Select a presettype , set the link option to "link feature" and choose a form in the form pool. With the AT filter you can select all attributes to which this form should not be applied</li>
		<li>New command line access : Art-Net input on/off. sACN on/off</li>
		<li>Command DMX at full and DMX at 0 will be executed without "please"</li>
		<li>OFF fixture thru or Off selection use now the programm time. "OFF fixture thru fade x" and "OFF selection fade y" follow the time as well</li>
		<li>New Command: RESETDMXSELECTION: Resets the selection in the DMX Tester</li>
		<li>New Hardkey to access "Mask": MA+2xGroup</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="warning">The command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and the select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers for fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">Selecting multiple fixtures with a lasso in the layout view is respecting the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">Release version <strong>2.3</strong> of grandMA2 divorced values and effect values! Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>Show file Conversion from Version 2.2 and earlier: The speed of a selective effect, stored in a cue, will not be brought correct into programmer, if the cue gets edited and the default speed of the effect in the pool is not 60 BMP.</li>
	<li>ASCII show import supports Strand ASCII show files only.</li>
</ul>
