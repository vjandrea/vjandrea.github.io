<h2>Version 2.1.0.6 - released 2010-11-30</h2>

<p><strong>MAIN FEATURE OVERVIEW: </strong></p>

<p>+ grandMA2 iPod/iPad Remote</p>

<p>+ Partial show read</p>

<p>+ DMX Tester</p>

<p>+ Full VPU configuration</p>

<p>+ RDM</p>

<p>+ Artnet in / new protokols</p>

<p><strong>IN DETAIL: </strong></p>

<p>+ Remote for i-pod is implemented. Remote must be enabled in the setup. (setup/console/global settings)</p>

<p>Note: It is not allowed to login as administrator or as guest. Remote needs a own user / userprofile. Max. two remotes are permitted to connect with a desk. http://itunes.apple.com/app/grandma2-remote/id403226319?mt=8</p>

<p>+ Implementation of Partial show read (PSR).</p>

<p>1. Use the "partial showread initialize" dialog. (backup menu)</p>

<p>2. In the view "partial show read prepare" a wizard helps you to select. Attn. Your setup might be changed.</p>

<p>3. Inside the "partial show read" a "PSR tree" dialog will show to help to merge or overwrite new parts to the existing show.</p>

<p>Note1: PSR follows the current world</p>

<p>Note2: When a sequence which contains effects based on presets is the source, then PSR imports sequence, effects, presets simultaneously</p>

<p>Note3: The current implementation doesn't work with user profiles.</p>

<p>PSR Syntax for commandline:</p>

<p>"PSRLIST Sequence" ( shows all available/changed sequences of the showfile which should be inserted )</p>

<p>"PSRPrepare [filename] [/usemine]" (uses the current setup).</p>

<p>or "PSRPrepare [filename] [/mergeother]" (merge with the new setup).</p>

<p>or "PSRPrepare [filename] [/useother]" (overwrites the current setup and uses only the new setup).</p>

<p>Shortcuts are:</p>

<p>[/usemine] = [/um]</p>

<p>[/mergeother]" = [/mo]</p>

<p>[/useother] = [/uo]</p>

<p>"PSR seq x" ( eg. x=1 ; PSR on the sequence )</p>

<p>"PSR seq x if channel y thru z" (PSR on seq with filtered "if")</p>

<p>+ "DMX tester" is implemented (Direct access to DMX values).</p>

<p>A click into the dmx sheet, or double click on the channel button (DMX) opens a new encoder toolbar.</p>

<p>Note1: The values from the DMX tester are indentified by a blinking white square.</p>

<p>Note2: The priority of the DMX tester output is higher than all other values, even parked. Exception: In case of DMX-in / Artnet-in values they'll be only owerwritten HTP-wise.</p>

<p>+ The dmx-sheet can be used interactive with the commands park, unpark, off. e.g. "park" and touch on a Address in the dmx view. (park this channel)</p>

<p>e.g. "assign channel x" and touch on a Address in the dmx view. (patched this channel)</p>

<p>+ VPU content distribution is implemented. (setup/network/ma network configuration/video).</p>

<p>+ VPU backup manager implemented. (setup/network/ma network configuration/video).</p>

<p>+ Full VPU configuration from desk. (setup/network/ma network configuration/video). (Dispay, sdi, pixelmapper, main settings, ...)</p>

<p>+ RDM found its first implementation (setup/show/patch&amp;fixture schedule/RDM devices)</p>

<p>RDM must be enabled in the setup. (setup/console/global settings)</p>

<p>"update" displays the basic information from the RDM devices over all DMX outputs connected to your grandMA2 or MA NPU.</p>

<p>Note1: RDM is disabled by default everytime when loading a show.</p>

<p>Note2: The RDM information are only visible on the session Master (or a standalone desk).</p>

<p>A better GUI, Error checks and more device information will be provided in later software versions.</p>

<p>WARNING: Please disable RDM if you experience strange behaviour of attached DMX devices (like fixtures, etc.). Some of those doesn't have the compliant DMX implementation and will corrupt the whole DMX output.</p>

<p>+ Artnet-in is implemented (setup/network/dmx protocols/artnet)</p>

<p>Artnet can be setup in a more detailed way (multiple rows)</p>

<p>Notes: In the column "mode" you can switch between input and output. Every MA universe can be assigned only to one artnet universe. The column "Valid" indicates that the settings are correct. On the right side, you can switch the input and output active.</p>

<p>+ All network protocols are send from the master in a network session only. When there is no slave in the session, the "Network DmxOut if alone" button must be switch on, to send out the protocols. This option is stored for every desk. You'll find it in the setup/console/local settings. (a red frame = protocols are not send, a green frame = send)</p>

<p>+ Pathport OUT protocol is implemented (setup/network/dmx protocols/pathport)</p>

<p>+ KINET-1 network protocol is implemented. (setup/network/dmx protocols/KINET1)</p>

<p>Note: It is used by Philips Color Kinetics.</p>

<p>+ Enhanced EXPORT / IMPORT - functionality</p>

<p>Deep changes in the way Export and Import is performed are done.</p>

<p>The following parts of a Showfile can be exported: Macros, Colors, Effects, Fixture Types, Layers, Fixtures, Subfixtures, Sequences, Cues.</p>

<p>More parts will follow in further releases.</p>

<p>For those who can handle xslt-files you'll find first templates for stylesheets in the "styles"-folder.</p>

<p>When exporting any of above mentioned parts to an USB-stick one of the following folders will be added: "macros"; "library"; "effects"; "colors" importexport (all the rest).</p>

<p>In case a fitting stylesheet exists (on the USBStick or inside the desk) additionally a folder called "styles" will be created inside the existing folder importexport In order to display the output the usage of a standard web browser is required (tested on Internet Explorer and Firefox) The browser will automatically use the stylesheet named in the exported XML-file.</p>

<p>Using this feature it is possible to create a customized "documentation" following definable rules by editing the template stylesheet.</p>

<p>+ Backup over external server is implemented: (Backup menu, bottom left).</p>

<p>The backup can be performed from the master console only. It's possible to backup on USBstick, internal Harddrive or (when configured) on an external server.</p>

<p>In case an external server is configured every backup on every medium will additionally create a backup on this server. From "YourServer"-Tab it is only possible to load show files.</p>

<p>+ Executor Pages Pool displays the current Fader and Button Pages, shown "F" or "B"</p>

<p>+ Cuepartnames are possible.</p>

<p>+ Presettypes in the encoder toolbar show an indication which presettype a selected fixture has.</p>

<p>+ The feature Field in the encoder toolbar is reduced to accessible features (filtered by fixtures). e.g. a LED shows only "colormix", a moving light shows "color1", "color2" and "colormix".</p>

<p>+ Midi show controll: Midi Input is active, if Network is selected.</p>

<p>+ grandMA 3D: new column in materials grid: "Owner Name" (shows the name of the 3d object that owns it).</p>

<p>+ New (empty) shows contain always the fixture type "Dimmer 8Bit".</p>

<p>+ Widgets can show context sensitive help.</p>

<p>Press "Help" (or type "help" into the commandline) and click in the title of a window. -&gt; help opens a page explaining that window. (this works also on the bars at bottom of several sheets).</p>

<p>+ 4-port nodes support dmx-in on xlr-3 and xlr-4 now.</p>

<p>+ Playback masters are assignable. (Executor assign menu)</p>

<p>+ Highlight Mini Executor by Fader touch</p>

<p>+ Recursive Macros can be interrupted ("OFF + MACRO" stopps all macro execution including cue links and startup macros)</p>

<p>+ Switch off a desk brings a popup "save" / "don't save" showfile.</p>

<p>+ In the calculator it is possible to work with open alignings, e.g. "1 thru"</p>

<p>+ Store output works also for paused cue fades or effects now.</p>

<p>+ COLORDIM channels are real light emitter channels now. (stage view and 3d). They are active light sources of the fixture - equal to a "DIM" channel.</p>

<p>"COLORDIM1" = red = RGB red</p>

<p>"COLORDIM2" = green = RGB green</p>

<p>"COLORDIM3" = blue = RGB blue</p>

<p>"COLORDIM4" = amber</p>

<p>"COLORDIM5" = white</p>

<p>"COLORDIM6" = warm white</p>

<p>"COLORDIM7" = cool white</p>

<p>"COLORDIM8" = orange</p>

<p>"COLORDIM9" = red orange</p>

<p>"COLORDIM10" = purple</p>

<p>"COLORDIM11" = indigo</p>

<p>"COLORDIM12" = cyan</p>

<p>"COLORDIM13" = magenta</p>

<p>"COLORDIM14" = yellow</p>

<p>"COLORDIM15" = uv</p>

<p>Note: Real (non-virtual) DIM channels are multiplied with the current output color. Other color channels are filters (subtractive color).</p>

<p>+ Layout View shows the dimmer bar for virtual dimmer.</p>

<p>+ "Master SpeedRate fader" are automatically labeled now.</p>

<p>Used by a sequence = rate</p>

<p>Used by a chaser = speed</p>

<p>+ New canbus version 1.33 (Individual LED dimming, for service purposes only)</p>

<p>* The console settings in setup have been divided in "local settings" and "global settings".</p>

<p>Note: "local settings" are used only on the current desk, "global settings" are for all desks in a network session.</p>

<p>* The actual World for a user is stored in the showfile. Load a showfile brings every user in his world. When a user leave the full accsess, all other user keep there world after the show download.</p>

<p>* "Fixture sort" in channel or fixture sheet, shows now the right selection order. (no longer the physical order)</p>

<p>* When a user leaves the session, only highlight and solo are deactivated, programmer values will remain.</p>

<p>* Command and value columns inside the timecode-editor are editable via right click.</p>

<p>* Macros asking for keyboard entries can be cancelled by pushing "ESC"</p>

<p>* Number of Speed groups increased to 16</p>

<p>* MIB popup can now be used with the screen encoder.</p>

<p>* "Off effect 1 thru 10" repaired.</p>

<p>* Using "Load Cue" with a not existing cue number doesn't show that Cue number anymore (does actually nothing now).</p>

<p>* "Pause" works for effects in cues, when the option "effect speed" is switched on in the assign menü.</p>

<p>* "store /m group x" works now and merges without further demand.</p>

<p>* Remotes to executors uses the correct executor on the correct page again.</p>

<p>* When turning on the desk, the green LEDs indicating enabled executors are remembered again.</p>

<p>* The presettypes (eg."Position") above the encoders change their functionality no more, when selecting a presets from other presettypes (eg."Color").</p>

<p>* Screen 1/2 Navigation Encoder follow now all popup windows.</p>

<p>* Edit an empty macro pool object (blue Focus is on the line "new"), the first key press on keyboard opens a popup and is used as first letter for the command.</p>

<p>* A desk freezes no more when it is alone in the network with the screensaver on over long period.</p>

<p>* The special master "programmer time" is changed to the shorter name "program time" in new shows created with Ver. 2.1. and higher.</p>

<p>* Stage View and 3d: "Reset Camera" is repaired. * grandMA 3D: Initialization of shows runs a lot of faster.</p>

<p>* "off effect" does now work for all fixtures which are running with this effect. (in version 2.0 this command does only work for the selected fixtures)</p>

<p>* Build an effect with the "special effect" menu, does not put a "width" value into the programmer anymore</p>

<p>* Store an effect in a cue with individual effect information only (not from the effect pool) does work now.</p>

<p>* ASCII Profiles revised</p>

<p>* When cancelling a "session colisson dialog" with the "ESC" button, the desk leaves the session.</p>

<p>* Release tracking values (R) in tracking sheet, displayed darker now.</p>

<p>* It is no longer possible to change the sACN priority.</p>

<p>* Edit Fixture: By changing the attribute of a fixture module, the subattribute follows the change automatically, if...</p>

<p>- the channel type has exactly ONE channel function</p>

<p>- the existing channelfunction's subattribute is a default subattribute of the existing channeltype's attribute (default subattribute means, that the subattribute is the first child of its parent attribute)</p>

<p>* The command "park selection" works now. (as a new predifined macro available)</p>

<p>* Default values of COLORDIM channels will be set to 0, if the fixture has no dimmer channel.</p>

<p>* Layout View: Changing background color of a frame, the z-order is fixed now. Frames are always drawn behind fixtures. Change color to "transparent": Just rotate the color encoder counterclockwise. The color will turn to black and then to transparent.</p>

<p>* When 2 different users are working in the same world then changes given to this world by User A are displayed and updated also for User B.</p>

<p>* Fixture types in the setup are always displayed with a number at the beginning of their name and their mode (to distinguish similar fixture types).</p>

<p>* Updated fixture types and gobos from carallon lib 6.7</p>

<p>* New predefined macros. In all predefined macros, CLI = on.</p>

<p>* Sequence sheet: loop starts from the last cue, when trigger is "time" or "follow".</p>

<p>* Edit fixture types: The AutoCreate default for all channel sets inside channel function with the subattribute "DUMMY", "RESERVED", "NOFEATURE", "UNKNOWN", "MACROPART" is "False" (no AutoCreate will be performed)</p>

<p>* Fixture Sheet: After disabling "feature sort" features will be sorted back to default.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Known bugs and limitations: </strong></p>

<p>- Remote configuration of 2-Port Nodes via grandMA2 is shown right in the display of the nodes, but do not change the real output online. After resetting the nodes (disconnect/connect mains) everything is working fine.</p>

<p>- Fixture Types with more than 2 Mode channels may not work</p>
