<h2>Release Notes - Version 3.1.0.8</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>New functions and features in detail:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Presets</strong></p>

	<p>Improved workflow when editing presets.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Preset pool objects can contain universal, global, and selective data. Indicates by a displayed U, G and S depending on the included data. If more than one type of data is stored to a preset, e.g. a global preset with selective data for some fixtures, both referring letters, e.g. G and S, are displayed in the preset pool object.</li>
		<li>Default Preset scope can be adjusted per preset type in the Setup/Show/Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule/Fixture Types/Attribute &amp; Encoder Grouping or via preset pool options menu.
		<div class="hazard">Changing the preset scope will change the preset scope for all preset pools of the same preset type.</div>
		</li>
		<li>New store option&nbsp;<strong>Preset Type Default</strong>&nbsp;creates or merges presets according to the preset types default scope.</li>
		<li>The store option&nbsp;<strong>Preset Type Default</strong>&nbsp;is set by default when creating a new show file.</li>
		<li>New command line store option&nbsp;<strong>/auto</strong>&nbsp;to store presets using preset type default scope.</li>
		<li>Store /merge and Update will never change the type of preset. These commands will just add the stored data according to the current store mode.
		<ul>
			<li>/selective - merges programmer into preset</li>
			<li>/global - merges programmer into preset and removes all selective data of fixtures of the same fixture type with active programmer values of the preset.</li>
			<li>/universal - merges programmer into preset and removes all selective and global data of fixtures and fixture types with active programmer values of this preset.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fixture type fixtures
		<ul>
			<li>New keyword “FixtureType” (=&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">MA</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Fixture</span>) to address Universal and Global Fixture Type Fixtures via command line.</li>
			<li>One global fixture type instance will be created per fixture module. Having e.g. a LED Moving Head containing one main module and one RGB cluster module with multiple RGB cluster instances, the global fixture type fixture will contain one main module instance and one RGB cluster instance.</li>
			<li>Global fixture type fixtures are only displayed and accessible, when at least one fixture using this fixture type has a valid Channel or Fixture ID.</li>
			<li>Knocking via Please Please can be used in the preset edit mode.</li>
			<li>Command FixtureType X at FixtureType Y and Clone FixtureType X at FixtureType Y to copy or clone Global preset type content from one fixture type to another.</li>
			<li>Sheet masking rules like Prog only or active only, can be used when editing presets. These masks will apply for real and virtual fixtures.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>New programmer mask functionality. When editing a preset, the programmer will show fixture types representing the global/universal data stored in the preset. Editing and storing the values of these "special" fixtures will change the global/universal value stored in this preset.</li>
		<li>New sheet mask option&nbsp;<strong>Virtual Fixtures</strong>&nbsp;to create sheet masks showing only real fixtures and/or only fixture types in sheets.</li>
		<li>Update menu provides possibility to show and update embedded presets.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Programmer Playback Interaction</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Improved interaction between executors and programmer.</li>
		<li>Priority of effects assigned to executors can be adjusted via assign menu executor options.</li>
		<li>The following order of priorities is used by all sequence and effect playbacks. The priority can be adjusted in the executor assign menu options.
		<ul>
			<li>Super New executor priority&nbsp;<strong>Super</strong>. This priority is the LTP priority above any other playback or even programmer priority. With activated executor option Soft LTP, intensity super playback will be mixed with other playbacks until master fader is at 100%. When SOFT LTP is deactivated, the intensity will snap to master fader level of super priority executor when starting this executor.</li>
			<li>Programmer Programmer is fixed at this priority. This Priority is reserved for programmer only and cannot be assigned to any executor. Further adjustment of interaction between programmer and playback can be done by toggling the Freeze function on or off. When having Freeze off, also playbacks with lower priority can overwrite the programmer.</li>
			<li>Swap LTP with higher priority than HTP.</li>
			<li>HTP Highest Takes Precedence</li>
			<li>High High LTP priority</li>
			<li>LTP Normal LTP priority.(Latest Takes Precedence)</li>
			<li>Low Low LTP Priority.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Preview and Blind Programmer will be cleared when user logs out.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Tracking Shield</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>New Store option&nbsp;<strong>/Tracking Shield</strong>&nbsp;(/ts) is implemented. Tracking shield helps protecting the "look" of later cues when storing or updating a cue between other cues. Tracking shield operates by looking down the tracking sheet at each fixture that is about to be stored, searching for the next occurrence of the dimmer value is above zero. The system, for the lifetime of the Store operation, temporarily blocks the data that needs protection. Toggle the new store option Tracking Shield using the user key U3 in the store options menu.</li>
		<li>Additional Tracking Shield button in store encoderbar and update menu.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="important">Store options Tracking Shield and Cue Only are mutually exclusive. Enabling one of these options disables the other.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Clock, Time</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Custom alarm text can be added to countdown timers. The added text will be shown in the pop-up when a countdown expires.</li>
		<li>Command syntax can be executed when a countdown timer expires. Both options can be set in the countdown options dialog.</li>
		<li>Additional trigger modes for stopwatch and countdown. Link selected toggle and Link last go toggle. First press of GO starts Stopwatch/Countdown, second press of GO stops the stopwatch/countdown.</li>
		<li>Algebraic sign of location longitude was wrong and has been inverted.
		<div class="tip">grandMA2 uses the following definitions of positive and negative decimal latitude and longitude values:
		<ul>
			<li>Positive latitude values for coordinates of northern hemisphere, negative latitude values for coordinates of southern hemisphere.</li>
			<li>Positive longitude values for eastern hemisphere, negative longitude values for coordinates of western hemisphere.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		</li>
		<li>Support for USB GPS receivers added. GPS receiver has to be NMEA 0183 compatible. GPS position can be synced. Console time can be synced to GPS received time. Console time zone can be synced to longitude approximation of time zone. All settings can be enabled or disabled in the Setup / Console / Date and Time / GPS dialog.</li>
		<li>If not synced to GPS, Daylight savings can be adjusted in Setup / Console / Date and Time.</li>
		<li>Console time can be synced to Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Timecode</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>New timecode slot pool contains 8 configurable slots.</li>
		<li>Timecode slot pool in sheet style shows IP address of session member, receiving timecode, and provides access to edit pre roll and after roll per slot.</li>
		<li>Possibility of receiving up to 8 different SMPTE or MTC timecode signals per session simultaneously.</li>
		<li>Timecode slot pool shows type of receiving timecode. In sheet style, it shows IP address of console currently receiving this timecode in addition.</li>
		<li>Slot number can be chosen per timecode object in the timecode pool editor options.</li>
		<li>Chosen timecode slot is displayed in the upper right corner of each object in the timecode pool. Slot number of current selected timecode slot is displayed green colored, all other slots are displayed white colored.</li>
		<li>Mapping of XLR inputs to timecode slots can be done in the Setup/Network/Network Configuration/ dialog.</li>
		<li>New command: Assign Timecode X/Slot=Y to assign the timecode show X to the timecode slot Y via command line.</li>
		<li>Export timecode style-sheet time format 1/100 added.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Views</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Additional Info View modes, Link current cue and Link next cue. These modes will show the info of current/next cue of selected sequence.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Sheets:</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Preset Type Timing</strong></p>

		<p>Fade and delay times for each preset type can be edited inside the sequence executor sheet. If preset type time is set to anything other than none, cue fade and delay time will be overwritten by the preset type time for the referring preset type.</p>
		</li>
		<li>When enabled, CueZero is visible in the sequence executor sheet. Timings of cue zero can be edited. These timings will be used e.g. when GoBack with option cuetiming is used to fade from a values or effect value back to values tracking from cue zero. Cue Zero timing is also used when using Autostomp setting of executors.</li>
		<li>All non-editable columns and rows of cues and cue parts are indicated by a black background.</li>
		<li>New sheet filter&nbsp;<strong>Look,&nbsp;</strong>to show only attributes stored when using StoreLook command.</li>

		</ul>
		Examples:

		<ul>
			<li>Rate 5 Please sets Rate of current selected sequence to 5.</li>
			<li>Speed 30 Please sets Speed of current selected sequence to 30 Sec,Hz or BPM depending on user chosen speed readout.</li>
			<li>Rate 3 and pressing any executor button instead of please will set Rate of pressed executor to 3.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>New command UpdateThumbnails Mediaserver X. to trigger CITP UpdateThumbnails via macro. X is the row index of the media server in the CITP network dialog.</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>64bit grandMA2 application</strong></p>

	<p>grandMA2 has been migrated to 64bit. grandMA2 onPC and MA 3D application installer automatically installs 32bit or 64bit application depending on host operating system.</p>

	<div class="tip">Type of application can be checked with the command version in the command line response.</div>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Network DMX Protocols</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Art-Net
		<ul>
			<li>DMX output via Art-Net supports Auto detection and manually setting of Broadcast or Unicast network traffic per universe.
			<ul>
				<li>OutputAuto sends each DMX Universe Unicast to up to 5 receivers detected via ArtPoll. If more than 5 receivers or no receiver is requesting the referring universe, the referring universe will be send as broadcast.</li>
				<li>OutputUnicast sends the referring DMX Universes unicast to the IP address set in the IP column.</li>
				<li>OutputBroadcast sends the referring DMX Universes broadcast.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Support of Art-Net 3 has been implemented. Art-Net 3 provides 128 networks of 255 Universes. To be compatible with Art-Net 2 devices, set the Network parameter to 1.</li>
			<li>Art-Net Universe parameters have been split into Network(Range 1 thru 128), Subnet(Range 0 thru F) and Universe(Range 0 thru F).</li>
			<li>Art-Net traffic speed can be slowed down per config row via delay parameter.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Streaming ACN(sACN)
		<ul>
			<li>DMX output via sACN supports Unicast and Multicast network traffic.
			<ul>
				<li>When choosing Output Unicast mode, a valid IP address has to be entered in the IP column of the network protocols/sACN tab, Universes configured in this row will be sent Unicast to this IP address.</li>
				<li>When choosing Output Multicast, sACN will be sent as multicast network packets, the IP column will not be available in this case.</li>
				<li>sACN network traffic speed can be slowed down per network config row via delay parameter.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>DMX input via sACN supports Unicast and Multicast network traffic.
			<ul>
				<li>To change from output to input the column mode has to be edited. There are two possible input modes, Input Multicast and Input Unicast.</li>
				<li>Input Multicast will join the Multicast group of the referring DMX Input Universe.</li>
				<li>Input Multicast is limited to max. 10 Universes. If more than 10 rows are configured as Input Multicast, all rows beyond Multicast input row 10 will be invalid.</li>
				<li>Input Unicast is not limited and receives sACN data for the referring universe without joining any multicast group.</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="important">sACN input of grandMA2 console ignores sACN priorities.</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Misc</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Effect parameter Single Shot added. Single Shot effects can be started/restarted using Go, On or At command.</li>
		<li>Secondary IP of grandMA2 consoles and MA 4Port and MA 8Port Nodes can be viewed and changed inside the network config. Secondary IP of grandMA2 onPC, MA 3D and MA VPU can be viewed and changed in the Microsoft® Windows® network configuration.</li>
		<li>IP address of MA NPUs can be changed via network config dialog.</li>
		<li>MA-Net2 DSCP network setting can be adjusted in setup/console/global settings. This network parameter can be used in networks providing quality of service(QoS).
		<div class="tip">DSCP setting is supported by grandMA2 consoles and MA NPUs only.</div>
		</li>
		<li>SetIP commands always have to include an interface name. E.g. SetIP eth0 192.168.0.4 - SetIP commands ignore invalid interface names.</li>
		<li>DHCP
		<ul>
			<li>SetIP eth0 /DHCP enables DHCP support for the specified Interface. Use SetIP eth0 [IPaddress] to set interface to a specific address and disable DHCP.</li>
			<li>DHCP in combination with the “zero-configuration networking” technology will be the new factory default when executing the Format and Install.</li>
			<li>grandMA2 version 3.1.0 supports DHCP for grandMA2 console, grandMA2 onPC, MA NPU, MA 3D and MA VPU.</li>
			<li>If a grandMA2 console or MA NPU with activated DHCP cannot connect to a DHCP server, the console will use an automatically generated IP address in the range 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255. The first grandMA2 console or MA NPU in network will get the IP address 169.254.3.3.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="important">
		<p>The IP range 169.254.x.y is a defined area for Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) also known as zero-configuration networking technology. This technology generates collision free IP addresses in this defined IP subnet 169.254.x.y without forcing the user to set-up and maintains any DHCP and DNS Server.</p>

		<p>The IP range 169.254.x.y is a class B subnet with the associated subnet Mask 255.255.0.0. This means all IP addresses between 169.254.0.0 and 169.254.255.255 are in the same subnet.</p>

		<p>grandMA2 software version 3.0.0.5 and earlier forced the user to handle the IP addresses himself. Default IP address of MA devices was 192.168.0.4 and connecting more than one console or peripheral device resulted in IP collisions the user had to handle by applying unique IP addresses to each device. In current Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X operating systems, DHCP in combination with the “zero-configuration networking” technology is the standard. Enabling DHCP together with the “zero-configuration networking” technology also for grandMA2, simplifies networking for grandMA2 users. Advanced users still have the possibility to change the IP address, but are not forced to change the IP addresses anymore. Simple users can just connect windows computers running grandMA2 onPC, MA 3D or MA VPU with a console using default network settings without having to configure IP addresses or handling IP collisions.</p>
		</div>
		</li>
		<li>PSN protocol updated to v2.0.
		<div class="important">Be aware PSN protocol 1.7 and PSN protocol 2.0 are not compatible. All devices have to support the PSN protocol v2.0 to establish a valid PSN connection with a grandMA2 v3.1 and later.</div>
		</li>
		<li>User rights have been reviewed. User rights "None" allows changing views and selecting fixtures to sort or mask sheets only.</li>
		<li>grandMA2 fixture library changes
		<ul>
			<li>Library updated to Carallon Library v10.8</li>
			<li>Multi Instance Headmovers are visualized in MA 3D. If the physical data of the single pixels is not provided by the manufacturer, pixels are arranged automatically inside the head.</li>
			<li>Module beam Intensity of Main module reduced to zero, if light emitting instances are present in the fixture type.</li>
			<li>DMX Footprint of MultiInstance fixtures is displayed correctly in the fixture types table in setup.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>The commands, FlashOn, FlashGO, Go, Goback, Goto, Kill, On, Swop, SwopOn, SwopGo, Temp, Toggle, Top can be combined with cue modes. E.g. Goto Cue 5 /CueMode=XAssert. This command will Goto Cue 5 in XAssert Mode ignoring current stored cuemode of cue 5. These options can also be assigned to executor buttons using command line or the new assign executor button function pop-up.</li>
		<li>Reworked assign executor button pop-up. This pop-up shows all possible buttons. In case of options, a swipe button is shown next to the button.</li>
		<li>New Backup menu title button for Save removing of external USB devices.</li>
		<li>grandMA2 Plugin
		<ul>
			<li>grandMA2 provides now the possibility to create custom plugins.</li>
			<li>Plugin pool can be found at the “create basic window” system tab.</li>
			<li>Currently running plugins are shown in the most right tab of the Off menu.</li>
			<li>Plugins have to be created in programming language LUA 5.3. In addition special grandMA2 LUA commands are available. API and example files can be found in the /gma2/plugin folder.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="important">
		<p>In general, Lua&nbsp;is an extendible scripting language providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. In many cases such requirements are unique and only relevant for individual particular applications. It wouldn’t be a good idea to add a 'one off’ as a general functionality to the software core of grandMA2.</p>

		<p>Especially, television game shows, scenery parks and shows on fairs demand more and more logical and processing control from the grandMA2 system. Many of the topics could be handled by creating Macros. Lua&nbsp;is a solution to replace and extend complex Macros by simple Lua&nbsp;functions.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>With the grandMA2 Software Release V3.1 the implemented Lua&nbsp;version is completely overhauled and more childproof now. It changed its character from being a pure development tool without a safety-net to a fairly secure while powerful instrument. In general,&nbsp;Lua&nbsp;scripting is no longer more dangerous than a Macro or the Delete button.</p>

		<p>The demo file included also contains a description of how to use it. Users facing problems with working using&nbsp;Lua at this point, might consider to abstain from creating their own scripts. The MA-share.net may be the right place to exchange to Lua experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="important">Creation and using of plugins can go deeper into the system as the “normal” usage of a console. Therefore the technical support team of MA Lighting may not be able to help you in all circumstances when using complex LUA plugins and LUA plugins might have to be rewritten when migrating show files to future grandMA2 software version.</div>

		<li>How to use this feature:
		<ol>
			<li>Add and patch a MA Camera Control fixture in Patch and Fixture Schedule.</li>
			<li>Create a camera pool at an empty part of one of the console screens.</li>
			<li>Press&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Edit</span>&nbsp;and touch a camera pool object to open the editor.</li>
			<li>Set the focus to the fixture column, press the screen encoder and choose one of the patched MA Camera Control fixtures.</li>
			<li>As long as a camera is linked to a camera control fixture the camera can be controlled only via the camera control fixture.</li>
			<li>Camera control fixtures provide control of position, rotation and zoom values of the connected camera.</li>
			<li>It is possible to control more than one camera with one camera control fixture.</li>
			<li>X-Y-Z and rotation data of the camera is used as offset to the position and rotation parameters of the camera control fixture.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>MA VPU</h2>

<ul>
	<li>New Pixel Mapper implemented. The MA VPU use now the library of the grandMA2 console and will automatically copy patch, position, and fixture type into the MA VPU. If needed, changes of these values are automatically copied into the MA VPU as well. So if the positions are setup in the grandMA2 Stage View, the setup of the Pixel Mapper can be linked to grandMA2 console.
	<ul>
		<li>How does it work: Fixture Types do not have to be written separately for the MA VPU. So if the fixtures have been written and patched in the grandMA2 console, the MA VPU will use the Color RGB 1, Color RGB2 and Color RGB 3 Parameters of the patched Fixture Types. If no Color RGB 1 - 3 parameters are found, but a Dimmer Channel, RGB Data will be merged and send to the Dimmer Channel as intensity control instead. All other parameters will be send with the value of "0" by default. The editing of the Pixel Mapper Setup can be done in the MA VPU and in the grandMA2 console.</li>
		<li>In the MA VPU:
		<p>Go into the Pixel Mapper and in the library tab on the left side you can now select each Fixture Layer of the Setup that contains Fixtures you want to use. Select these Fixtures and use the "Add to Output" button. A pop-up will ask, which axis is used: any combination can be done and each axis can even be inverted. This is used to "transfer" the position from the 3D Stage View Environment into the 2D footprint in the MA VPU. This process is comparable to the option "take Camera" in the Layout View, but with fixed positions.</p>

		<p>Fixtures and channels can be stored in various Pixel Mapper Outputs, if needed to create a different mapping. The position data in the Pixel Mapper is not identically to the position data in the Stage View. It is only a two dimensional abstraction with its own position data. E.g. Fixture 1 thru 10 can be inserted with axis +x+z (the default axis, from the front view), while Fixture 11 thru 20 can be inserted with axis +x+y (from the top view). If the same Fixtures get inserted again into the same Output (or an overlapping range), the user gets prompted: "Overwrite positions from existing Fixtures." or "Add only new Fixtures. Existing Fixtures are untouched.". After Fixtures have been "transferred" into the Pixel Mapper, their position can be moved and adjusted. This will not cause any feedback into the grandMA2 console, just as in the Layout View. If, however the positions shall be updated again in the MA VPU, insert the Fixtures again into the wanted Pixel Mapper Output and choose "Overwrite". Patch and Fixture Type data are always connected to the grandMA2 setup. So if anything is exchanged in the console, these changes will be recognized and calculated for the MA VPU Pixel Mapper, e.g. a change from a Martin Mac 700 Wash to a GLP Impression will not be a problem any more.</p>
		</li>
		<li>In the grandMA2 console: A visual representation of the Pixel Mapper editor of the MA VPU has been built into the grandMA2. Create a new window in Other / VPU Pixel Mapper View. This window looks very similar to the window in the MA VPU. Only the library tab is missing. To work with this window, you can do the following: Areas and Outputs can be created, deleted, and edited as known from the MA VPU. To store fixtures and channels into an existing Pixel Mapper Output, select them, press&nbsp;<span class="hardkey">Store</span>&nbsp;and click into the area of your chosen output. If fixtures or channels have been selected, you can also use the command "Store PMArea 1.2 /axis=+X+Z " to store into Area 1, Output 2 with the Axis +X +Z. All parameters of each Pixel Mapper Area / Output can be controlled by the command line, too. Use the command "ChangeDestination PMArea" to get to the Pixel Mapper containers in the root. Pixel Mapper setups can also be copied or deleted. The can also be merged via command-line. E.g. copy PM 1.1 at 1.2 /merge. The following store options are implemented:
		<ul>
			<li>/merge</li>
			<li>/overwrite</li>
			<li>/remove</li>
			<li>/autoalign (shortcut = /aa) to ignore the 3D position data and to store like in the layout view as a matrix</li>
			<li>/x=3 /y=3 to define a position if the option autoalign is used</li>
			<li>/3dcoordinates to use the 3d coordinates</li>
			<li>and additionally the Axis /+x+y /+x+z and all the possible combinations with plus and minus</li>
			<li>/noconfirm</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="important">Note: Import / Export does not work via command-line in this version.</div>

		<p>After the Fixtures have been inserted into the Pixel Mapper, they can be selected by a rubber-band, moved and rotated, just as in the MA VPU Pixel Mapper editor. Use the top-line buttons&nbsp;<strong>select</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>move</strong>&nbsp;to change mouse behavior. To allow editing, activate the&nbsp;<strong>Setup&nbsp;</strong>button in the headline of the window. Also the Encoder Bar can be used to changed these values.</p>

		<div class="important">Note: MA-Tricks support is not implemented, yet. The handling of this editor is very close the Layout View of the grandMA2.</div>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>The grid mode shows all the options of each panel (the abstraction of fixtures and channels in the Pixel Mapper Editor) in a tabular view. Values can also be edited here, too. To send the data via MA-Net2, select the protocol in the options of the Output and enable the Pixel Mapper Main Render flag. A maximum of 256 universes can be send, and all 3 protocols share the same amount.</p>

		<p>So e.g. you can send 200 universes of MA-Net2, 20 Universes Art-Net and 36 Universes sACN. MA-Net2 is put out on Ethernet1, sACN and Art-Net are put out on Ethernet 2(on a MA VPU). To send the Pixel Mapper data back into the console, no additional Ethernet Cable is required.</p>
		</li>
		<li>To create a MA VPU Pixel Mapper setup that has more parameters then the console can calculate, use the following approach: In the setup of the grandMA2 console a new column per Fixture has been inserted&nbsp;<strong>No Parameter</strong>. If this column is set to yes, all the programming for this fixture is lost, it does not consume any parameters any more in the grandMA2 and the MA VPU will send out the default values defined in the fixture profile additional to the Color RGB 1-3 values. The idea: if this flag has been set (No Parameter), the Fixtures can still be selected, but only controlled by the MA VPU, not the console. Additionally the set default values for this Fixture are transmitted. These values can be changed (e.g Dimmer to 100%) in the grandMA2 / Patch &amp; Fixture Schedule / Fixture Types.</li>
		<li>New Pixel Mapper supports fixture types that allow circular pixel positioning. Since the restrictions are only from the grandMA2 side, any pixel / sub-fixture positioning can be done. A good example is the Ayrton Magic Panel 602 R.</li>
		<li>Pixel Mapper does now support MA-Net2 protocol to merge directly into the grandMA2 console. MA-Net2 is only possible for Pixel Mapper Outputs that are created in the new version.</li>
		<li>New and improved sACN and Art-Net stack for the Pixel Mapper implemented.
		<ul>
			<li>Art-Net: is now Art-Net 3.0 compatible and allows Unicast (Auto Mode). Requirement for Art-Net Unicast is an Art-Net receiver sending out valid ArtPoll reply packets. Otherwise these Universes will be send broadcast. This mode can be set per Output in the Art-Net mode. A delay can be set here to create an output shaping. A default value of 0.1 is a good value. Since Art-Net 3.0 supports more than 256 universes, the output can be shifted in 256 steps. By default the Art-Net Network is set to 1, which will result in the previous standard of universe 1 thru 256. To send in Universe 257 thru 512, set the Art-Net Network value to "2".</li>
			<li>sACN: The user can define: sACN Mode: Multicast or Broadcast sACN Priority: 0 thru 200, Default will be 100 (as in the grandMA2 console) sACN TTL: 0 thru 255 Even the last Output or Area can be deleted in the MA VPU now.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Pixel Mapper Setups are merged HTP in the VPU if they overlap. E.g. the user creates two setups for the same Fixtures, but he designs the Pixel Mapping differently with 2 different Camera inputs. Now the user can send the two outputs simultaneously and they are HTP merged in the MA VPU before the same universes get send out only once.</li>
		<li>
		<p>VPU Integrated Pixel Mapper: a MA VPU software running on any PC / Laptop can now transmit Pixel Mapper data on the universes that are granted in the DMX List / Universe Pool. This depends on the amount of unlocked Parameters of the Session, where the PC / Laptop with MA VPU software running has to be a session member.</p>

		<p><strong>No MA VPU Hardware is required!</strong></p>

		<p>Install the VPU software on any Windows 7 / 8 PC, install the Main Concept MPEG2 Decoder. Start the MA VPU software, take it into the session that has granted universes (e.g. even an onPC with an MA 2Port Node onPC in session) and allow Pixel Mapper Outputs, that are set to MA-Net2, to be transmitted. This is then merged (HTP) into the grandMA2. Only the Parameters in an output, that are granted, are transmitted.</p>

		<div class="important">Note: sACN and Art-Net are not transmitted.</div>
		</li>
		<li>
		<div class="important">Pixel Mapper created in version 3.0.0.5 or below, cannot be changed or edited. Only the Output Parameters can be changed. No new fixtures can be inserted and the Output cannot be changed to MA-Net2, since the patching is not necessary alike to the grandMA2. If the "new features" shall be used, the setup of the Pixel Mapper has to be done again in the new style. In contrast to the grandMA2 console, the MA VPU Pixel Mapper works based on Fixtures and not on Sub-Fixtures. So only entire Fixtures can be controlled, not single pixels of it. If the resolution of the rendered output is low, the layer objects are not in the center automatically. This has to be adjusted manually via the V_Pos-Parameters. The selection of panels in the MA VPU Pixel Mapper View and in the MA VPU itself are not synced. If the Pixel Mapper Tab is opened in the MA VPU software, then this may result in low FPS output rate. For show situations, please enable the Show Mode to avoid this or switch to another tab if no changes on the Pixel Mapper Setup are needed any more.</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Restart, Reboot and Shutdown-Behaviour is now equal to the grandMA2-Series:
	<ul>
		<li>Restart-command restarts the VPU-Application</li>
		<li>Reboot-command reboots the whole MA VPU</li>
		<li>Shutdown-command shuts down the MA VPU</li>
	</ul>
	Also Media-PCs listen to these commands. There is a new Flag 'Accept Shutdown commands' in the Settings-Main-Menu for Media-PCs for allowing to execute the Reboot and Shutdown-Commands. If this flag is disabled, only a Restart of the VPU-Application is forced instead of rebooting or shutting down the whole Media-PC.</li>
	<li>MA VPU grabs now another IP address as the preferred one, if cable is not inserted by booting. This is also indicated with a red background in the IP-field on status screen and in the Networks-Settings.</li>
	<li>The MA VPU software does now support Portrait view settings in the MA VPU software.</li>
	<li>CITP MSEX connection is now also compatible with version 1.0 and 1.1 of the protocol. That allows CITP MSEX video streams to be displayed in WYSIWYG Version 34.</li>
	<li>New display of the Teaser Mode in the Status Bar in the bottom of the UI screen. If no Dongle is inserted and the Teaser Mode Conditions are met, the Dongle Indicator changes to Teaser Mode and displays a green check-mark.</li>
	<li>The Text Ticker can now be used easily on different resolutions. The setup of the Text Ticker object is now relative and the text ticker is rendered.</li>
	<li>New Fixture Types added for Layer and Camera.</li>
	<li>New Mask “No Parameter” to show or hide Pixel Mapper only fixtures in sheets.</li>
	<li>New Effects added
	<ul>
		<li>box_displacement: displace the image like a checkerboard</li>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<div class="warning">Down-dating to grandMA2 Release v3.0.0.5 and earlier requires a Factory reset (Format and Install). Please backup your show files before down-dating.</div>

<div class="warning">Inserting the command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers of fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">When multiple fixtures are selected with a lasso in the layout view, the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons are respected. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">The network switch IGMP Snooping functionality has to be switched off in order to be able to update MA 2Port Nodes.</div>

<div class="warning">A grandMA1 compatibility mode is no part of grandMA2 console software 3.0 and later. When grandMA1 compatibility mode is needed, grandMA2 consoles and MA NPUs have to be down-dated to grandMA2 v2.9.1.1</div>

<div class="warning">The MA-Net2 protocol has changed to support the MA 8Port Node devices. All MA devices need a new network streaming protocol with the 2.9 software. Once updated to the correlating version to grandMA2 v2.9, 2Port, 4Port, 8Port, NSP MA 4Port Node and the MA NDP will no longer work in a session with an older network streaming protocol (e.g. grandMA2 v2.8). Down-dating MA 2Port Nodes or NSP running in MA 4Port Node Mode to be v2.8 compatible is only possible via grandMA1 v 6.801. All other devices can be down-dated via USB or windows installer only.</div>

<div class="warning">Exec Time can be used for Executor buttons and Executor Faders. The new Executor option "Ignore Exec Time" has been added in the Assign menu. When this option is enabled, the referring executor will use its own off time instead of the Exec Time Fader Timing. Show files stored with grandMA2 v2.9.1 and earlier will be converted. All Fader executors will have this option disabled. Executor option defaults are valid for fader and button executors.</div>

<div class="warning">Fixture type preset reference contains values only. It is not possible to add any fade, delay or effect data to fixture type preset references.</div>

<div class="warning">ASCII show import supports Strand, Transtechnik and ADB ASCII show files.</div>

<div class="warning">A CITP connection is not possible when running CITP sender and CITP receiver at the same computer.</div>

<div class="tip">Following syntax can be used to switch off faders only or buttons only of current page or of all pages except current page:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Faders of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Buttons of current page.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 1 thru 100 Page Thru - $faderpage</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Faders of all pages except current.</li>
	<li><strong>Off Executor 101 thru 240 Page Thru - $buttonpage</strong>&nbsp;- This switches off all Buttons of all pages except current.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="tip">Addressing executors via command-line has been improved to provide support for addressing by name or number. This can be used when sending playback commands to specific executors or when storing to a specific executor, sequence or cue for example. All existing cue links and Macros of show files stored with former grandMA2 versions will be converted as far as possible. Please check cue links and Macros of existing shows when loading them the first time with this version. Some cue links and Macros may have to be adjusted. When creating new Macros or cue links or editing existing ones, the new syntax as described below has to be used.
<ul>
	<li>Go Exec "exec name" - start executor with specified name on current page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "exec number" - start executor with specified number on current page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "*"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on all pages</li>
	<li>Go Exec "*"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on all pages</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page name"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec name" - start executor with specified name on specified page</li>
	<li>Go Exec "page number"."exec number" - start executor with specified number on specified page</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

	<li>Before loading show files stored with grandMA2&nbsp;<strong>v2.7.x</strong>&nbsp;the first time with grandMA2 v2.9.x, attribute Colormix4 and 5 and Colordim4 and 5 of self-made fixture types have to be manually adjusted to fulfill the color specification. Amber has to be Colormix 4 invert or Colordim 4 without invert, and White has to be Colormix 5 invert or Colordim 5 without invert. Otherwise, color information of these fixture types will be lost after loading show file with v2.9.</li>
	<li>The Feature name for ColorDim/ColorMix has changed into MixColor. Macros using one of these feature names have to be adjusted.</li>
	<li>Known limitation when loading show files stored with&nbsp;<strong>v2.8.x</strong>&nbsp;for the first time in v2.9
	<ul>
		<li>Special Masters have a new data structure in grandMA2 software.

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>MA 4Port and MA 8Port Nodes have to be updated to v1.0.9 or later to be compatible with grandMA2 v2.9. MA 2Port Nodes have to be updated to 1.77 or later in order to be compatible to grandMA2 v2.9.</li>
	<li>Channelset labels of fixture types have to be unique to be visible and accessible in calculator. E.g.: If channel sets of Attribute Shutter are closed, open, open, open, only one open is visible in the calculator. Changing channel set labels to closed, open, open(2), open(3), will result in all channel sets being visible in the calculator.</li>
	<li>Astronomical clock always calculates time according to standard time zone. Additional summer times are not recognized and cannot be adjusted manually when using sunset, dusk, dawn, and sunrise in the agenda.</li>
	<li>LUA command gma.gui.confirm() is not supported by this version.</li>
