<h2>New functions and features in detail:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Software Update via Network </strong>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Software Update via Network has been implemented. Minimum Streaming version for software update via network is grandMA2 [2.8.0]. Stations running former grandMA2 versions have to be updated the known way via USB. Network Update can be found at /setup/console/Software Update. List of stations to update can be filtered by session ID. Stations already running same version are hidden by default. Activating show same version will also show stations running same version. Software Update via network also supports updating multiple stations simultaneously by press and hold CTRL and select multiple stations. grandMA2 consoles and grandMA2 onPCs can be used to update other grandMA2 consoles, NPUs, MA 3D,MA VPUs MA 4Port Nodes and grandMA2 onPCs running grandMA2 Streaming [2.8.0] or later.</p>

		<p>To be able to update via network, please download the following files from MALighting.com:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>grandMA2[streaming gMA2][streaming gMA1].update</li>
			<li>4Port_[version].update,</li>
			<li>MA 3D Installer ( gMA3D_[version][streaming].exe )</li>
			<li>MA VPU Installer ( gMA-VPU_[version][streaming].exe )</li>
			<li>grandMA2 onPC installer. ( gMA2onPC_[version][streaming].exe )</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Copy all files needed for your devices to an empty USB drive root directory. USB drive should use FAT32 file system. The USB drive has to be connected to the transmitting grandMA2 console or computer running grandMA2 onPC while updating.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Software update via network is also possible using command line. Syntax would be "UpdateSoftware [IP-Address]" Update Please would update current console. USB drive containing update files as described above has to be connected to grandMA2 console or computer running grandMA2 onPC while updating via command line as well.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Setup </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>New Handling of additive and subtractive color mixing fixtures.
		<ul>
			<li>Due to the raising amount of LED fixtures and to improve fixture exchange, the former features Colormix and Colordim have been exchanged by a new Feature called ColorRGB. grandMA2 library has been converted. Show files will be converted when loading the show file the first time with grandMA2 v2.8.0.</li>
			<li>Generic LED fixtures from grandMA2 library always contain a dimmer. Fixtures not having a real dimmer inside their dmx footprint will get a virtual one. Virtual dimmers work like a master for all ColorRGB attributes.</li>
			<li>New sheet readout option to choose sheet and encoder readout between Default, RGB and CMY. Per Default all sheets will follow global readout setting which can be changed at /setup/user/settings/Default Color mode. . This option changes the readout only. Fixture types will still use ColorRGBs. Encoder Color readout will follow last touched sheet readout. For fast readout switching a special title button color readout can be activated inside sheet options title button tab.</li>
			<li>Special Dialogue Color has new option Link Encoders to control special dialog faders via encoder. With activated link encoder encoder 1, 2 and 3 will control the choosen special dialog colorfaders.</li>
			<li>Edit Setup / Fixture Types / Attribute + Encoder Grouping: New Color Feature "ColorRGB". This feature replaces former features Colormix and ColorDim. Default ColorRGB colors are: ColorRGB1=Red, ColorRGB2=Green, ColorRGB3=Blue, ColorRGB4=Amber, ColorRGB5=White, ColorRGB6=Warm White, ColorRGB7=Cool White, ColorRGB8=Orange, ColorRGB9=Red Orange, ColorRGB10=Purple, ColorRGB11=Indigo, ColorRGB12=Cyan, ColorRGB13=Magenta, ColorRGB14=Yellow, ColorRGB15=UV, ColorRGB16=Green Cyan, ColorRGB17=Medium White.</li>
			<li>Attribute and Encoder Grouping and Edit Fixture Type dialogue got a new column Color. These Colors will be used for displaying light output color inside StageView and 3D and will also be used for colorpicker color calculation at future grandMA2 versions.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>grandMA2 Fader Wing
		<ul>
			<li>Graphic mode has been added to Setup / Console / Faderwing + Monitor Setup. Current connected hardware is marked by green check marks.New surfaces can be added or removed inside this dialog. This dialog can be used to arrange screens for mouse cursor navigation through all screens. To assign a screen encoder of an external fader wing to an external screen, the fader wing has to be moved above or below the screen. A grey encoder icon inside external screen symbol displays a correct assigned screen encoder. Pressing edit and touching any module or right mouse click any module can be used to assign a different part of current executor page to a fader module and to change screen assignment of external screens. Default surface 1 is locked and cannot be changed.</li>
			<li>Surfaces can also be changed using command line. E.g. The command Surface 2 will switch to surface 2.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Fixture Types
		<ul>
			<li>Fixture type library menu has been improved. Library will be displayed as table and can be sorted by any column and filtered by manufacturer or fixture type. DMX footprint, number of instances and fixture info is also displayed inside this menu. Manufacturer and Fixture Type filter algorithm has been improved to be able to find fixtures without knowing the exact file name.Fixture filter filters by fixture and mode column. Info window displays attribute to DMX mapping, Info and Revision Notes of currently focused fixture. Info window can be hidden using the i title bar button.</li>
			<li>By default, all fixture types are using a generic 3D model depending on the class of the fixture module. Custom 3D models can be assigned to fixture types inside module manager using model column. Module manager can be found at /Setup/Patch and Fixture Schedule/Fixture Types/Module Manager. Multi Instance fixtures can have a fixture housing model in addition to the module manager subfixture models. These housing 3D models are assigned by choosing them inside model column of fixture type table. Exporting a fixture type includes assigned 3D model. Exchanging a 3D model of a single fixture can be done using 3D application or using /Setup/Patch Live/Fixture Position/ dialog model column.</li>
			<li>"New keyword ""Model"" for 3d models in show file E.g. the command ""List Model"" lists all 3D models of this show file. The already existing keyword ""Items3D"" has been renamed to ""Item3D"" The syntax Assign [model] at [item3d] has been implemented to assign 3D models to fixtures using command line or macros. E.g. "Assign model 2 at item3d 10"</li>
			<li>Fixture type info editor has been reworked. Fixture types can contain Infos and Revision Notes with time stamps. Time stamps are automatically created, when manually adding Infos or revision notes.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Patch
		<ul>
			<li>Patch dialog has been reworked. Touching a DMX address at the right part of the patch dialog patches current focused fixture to touched DMX address. Right hand side of patch dialog only shows one universe at a time. Universe can be chosen via green soft key above scrollbar. A new Patch encoder bar has been implemented. Encoder one can be used to scroll through left all fixtures displayed at the left side of patch dialog. Encoder 2 and 3 can be used to choose DMX Universe and Address. Pressing Encoder 3 will patch current focused fixture(s) to chosen DMX address.</li>
			<li>Patch dialog DMX Test Output functionality has been implemented. Encoder 4 of the new Patch dialog encoder bar can be used to set to a Level to test current chosen DMX address. Be aware using the Test DMX Output functionality of the patch dialog also affects and resets DMX Tester generated DMX Output.</li>
			<li>Setup / User / Settings: New User Option "Patch Column Readout is absolute DMX Address". Activating this option will display DMX Addresses as absolute values instead of separated by Universe and Address inside this universe. E.g. 2.500 = 1012. Additional, this option can be changed inside DMX Patch dialog.</li>
			<li>Create Multipatch has been moved from patch to fixture layer dialog. Mulitpatches can include 3D models to be visualized in Stage View and MA 3D. Multipatch fixtures will be displayed as Master/Slaves in Fixture Layer. Deleting Master will move next multipatch up to be new Master. Position of Multipatch fixtures can be adjusted inside fixture position dialog which can be found at the Patch and Fixture Schedule or Patch Live dialog.</li>
			<li>Patching using Commandline: Assign Fixture X at DMX Y deletes current patch of fixture X and patches fixture X at DMX address Y. Assign DMX Y at Fixture X creates a Multipatch for DMX Y at Fixture X. Assign DMX Y at Fixture X /reset will delete any MultiPatch of Fixture X.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Multi Selection of Executors has been implemented. Press and hold select key and choose more than one executor. Last selected executor is displayed with light green background, all other selected executors are displayed with dark green background. The commands On, Off, Go+, Go-, Pause, Fast Forward, Fast Backwards and Top Please will be executed by all currently selected executors. Selecting a single Executor will deselect all other executors.</li>
		<li>grandMA2 consoles and NPUs can be remote rebooted or shut down via network using station IP address. E.g. The command Shutdown 192.168.0.4 will shutdown console or NPU with IP address 192.168.0.4 Reboot and shutdown can be canceled within 10s at the station receiving a remote reboot or shutdown command.</li>
		<li>Column width of setup tables has been included in user profile.</li>
		<li>Improved Multiuser Access Conflicts. E.g. As long as a user is changing a name, number or timing of a cue, other users cannot modify this cue. If another user tries to edit or modify this cue, he will get a automatically disappearing warning pop-up.</li>
		<li>Pressing MA+. will add Default to the command line without automatically executing this command anymore. E.g. Pressing MA+. and an Encoder bar Presettype button afterwards will add default values for chosen Presettype.</li>
		<li>New command "menu /reset" to switch all dialogs back to default screen.</li>
		<li>New option for command Call: status Call Cue 3 activates all values of Cue 3 in programmer. Values of Cue Zero thru Cue 2.999 will be inactive in programmer. Call Cue 3 /status activates all values of Cue Zero thru Cue 3 in programmer.</li>
		<li>It is possible to reference Fader and Button pages by name using wildcards. E.g. Off Page "Song*" will switch off all pages with page labels starting with "song".</li>
		<li>The store option "Status Merge" includes also effects.</li>
		<li>The commands Record Macro x and Record Timecode x will create a new macro/ timecode object, if object does not already exist. The commands Off Macro and Off Timecode without any following number will switch off all currently running macros or timecode playbacks.</li>
		<li>Channelpage buttons can be disabled and Faderpage and Buttonpage buttons can be linked to switch complete pages. Option can be set at Setup / User / GrandMaster + B.O. Settings.</li>
		<li>"add multiple" to add more than one new remote input row in Setup / Show / Remote Inputs Setup / Analog - Midi - DMX Remotes.</li>
		<li>Setup / Network / MA Network Configuration: onPCs are displayed inside a new TAB.</li>
		<li>Fixture Type Creation Choose Attribute dialog has been improved.</li>
		<li>Kill can be used with or without considering Executor Off-time. Option can be set using Setup/Show/Playback+MIB Timing.</li>
		<li>New Option in User Setting:Setup / User / Settings / "Disable Viewbutton and View CLI". (CLI = Command line Interaction). With this option activated Views and Viewbuttons will not interact with the command line anymore. E.g. Hitting the store button to store a group and realizing you have to change the View to get a group pool would not accidently store a view anymore.</li>
		<li>"Value Encoder resolution can be changed per attribute using Attribute and Encoder Grouping dialog or by using command line: Assign Attribute """"/EncoderResolution. E.g. Assign Attribute ""Tilt"" /EncoderResolution=fine.</li>

		<li>Stage Markers have been implemented. Stage markers are Moving Paths other fixtures using XYZ can refer to. XYZ beam position of fixtures not assigned to any stage marker are absolute XYZ coordinates in 3D space. XYZ beam position of fixtures assigned to a stage marker are relative to this stage marker's position. Moving, Rotating or Scaling a Stage marker will recalculate all XYZ beam positions of fixtures using this stage marker according to the changes made with the stage marker.</li>
		<li>New Executor assign menu option "Forced Pos." to choose fixture position feature fades between always Pan/Tilt Fade (PT), always XYZ Fade(XYZ) and Auto. Auto mode will fade attributes as stored. Pan Tilt values fade in Pan Tilt mode and XYZ values fade in XYZ mode. The same setting can be chosen per cue using new sequence executor sheet column. A forced transition mode per cue will always overwrite forced transition mode set per sequence.</li>
		<li>Stage View Calibration mode provides new button Stage values. This button will set current selected fixtures attributes to values of the fixture type stage column. Warning: grandMA2 library fixtures stage values are not set to be able to use this functionality stage values have to be set in fixture type first.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sound </strong>
	<ul>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<div class="warning">If you would like to update your dimMA system from any version below 7.x please contact your MA-dealer or MA direct for any update information. Should you be using grandMA2 in connection to our dimMA solutions, please get in touch with us, since a console update will now require a NDP update and vice versa. We are happy to assist you.</div>

<div class="warning">The command "store /remove" or pressing [store][cue][2] and the select [remove] in the pop-up will remove the whole attribute with all (!!) its layers for fixtures having any value or effect layer of this attribute active in programmer. It can be filtered to only remove values, value timings or effects by using the buttons in the stored encoder bar. To remove only specific layers, for example only individual effect fade, the operator needs to open the calculator for these layers and select "remove" in the calculator. Afterwards the operator needs to update the cue, or has to use store /merge to remove the specific layers.</div>

<div class="warning">Selecting multiple fixtures with a lasso in the layout view is respecting the snap grid settings to interpolate small position differences of fixture icons. The selection order will always be made inside of one snap grid cell first, afterwards line by line in the direction of the lasso movement.</div>

<div class="warning">
<ul>
	<li>Release version <strong>2.3</strong> of grandMA2 divorced values and effect values! Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Therefore please check your show file with the new version before using it live!</li>
	<li>With Version 2.5.70 the default speed of effects and the rate of effect lines has been exchanged by a single speed per line. Therefore older show files might not be 100% compatible. Please check your show file with the new version before using it live!!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="important">
<ul>
	<li>show file Conversion from Version 2.2 and earlier: The speed of a selective effect, stored in a cue, will not be brought correct into programmer, if the cue gets edited and the default speed of the effect in the pool is not 60 BMP.</li>
	<li>ASCII show import supports Strand ASCII show files only.</li>
	<li>MA onPC command wing DMX input is supported for the ports "DMX In" and "DMX out A" only. The port "DMX out B" is allowed to be used as DMX out only!</li>
