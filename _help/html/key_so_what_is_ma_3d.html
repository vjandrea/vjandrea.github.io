		<h1>What is MA 3D?</h1>
		
		<p>The MA 3D is a free visualizer that can connect to the MA system and can simulate lights in a 3D environment.</p>

<p>The software needs to be installed on a computer connected to your lighting network.</p>

<p>The 3D is invited into a session and it is then considered a member in the session that can be used to position lighting fixtures in a 3D environment.</p>

<p>The 3D can be used to preprogram a show and/or have it onsite for Blind and Preview editing.</p>

<p>MA 3D can connect to grandMA2 onPC (also free) and does not need parameters to visualize the lighting.</p>

<p>You can add a virtual camera dolly and program a moving camera.</p>

<p>An object in MA 3D can be used as a surface that can display video or images. It can also display the CITP video stream from a media system. Read more about CITP in the <a href="key_network_citp_stream.html">Streaming CITP topic</a>.</p>

<p>MA 3D can create screenshots. If a video capture is needed, then additional capture software is needed.</p>
